OpenERP 7.0 implements a custom javascript search view for move lines. This
search view shows dropdowns for period and journal. By default, these are
set to the default journal and (current) period.

This module leaves the search view extension for move lines intact, but
disables the default search values for the dropdowns so that you do not
have to disable these before entering your own search queries.
