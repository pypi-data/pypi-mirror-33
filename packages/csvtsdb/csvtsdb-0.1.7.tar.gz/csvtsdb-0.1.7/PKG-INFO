        Not your typical timeseries database:

        Implies you probably don't want to use it unless you know you do. A good
        use case is for *small amounts of data* that should be *easily editable
        and/or readable in 30 years* when your favorite real TSDB software is
        long dead.
        
        I will use it in my personal tracking project (TBA), which expects about
        1 datapoint per series per day (and a small number of series), because
        most datapoints are input by the user.
        
        **Note**: if you want to use this, but you are not happy with the
        request format (e.g. you want JSON), `let me
        know <https://github.com/AnotherKamila/csvtsdb/issues/new>`__ -- that is
        a very easy change.
        
        This is a WIP and it will have more features in the future.
