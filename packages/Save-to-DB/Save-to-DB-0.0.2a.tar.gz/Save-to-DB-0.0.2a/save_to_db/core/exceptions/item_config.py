""" This module contains exceptions for
:py:class:`~save_to_db.core.item.Item` class configuration. These
exceptions are only raised when an item configuration is correct in its
structure but cannot be used, for example, when a nonexistent relation is used.
If, for example, a boolean value was used instead of a list, general exception
will be raise when trying to deal with a boolean as with a list.
