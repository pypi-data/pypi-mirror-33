Description: mwm.py
        ======
        
        It is a python library to read contents of MAPS.ME mwm files. Not
        everything is supported, but you can get at least all the features and
        their attributes. We at MAPS.ME use this script to do analytics and
        maintenance.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install mwm
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Just add ``import mwm`` to your script, and read an mwm file with:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            with open('file.mwm', 'rb') as f:
                data = mwm.MWM(f)
        
        Tools
        -----
        
        The package installs the ``mwmtool`` command-line script. It shows
        statistics about an MWM file, can search for features or convert ids.
        Run it with ``-h`` to see a list of options.
        
        The script source can serve as a library usage example.
