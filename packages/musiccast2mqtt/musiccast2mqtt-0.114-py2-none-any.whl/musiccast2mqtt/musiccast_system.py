''' Representation of the Audio-Video system, including non-MusicCast devices.

.. reviewed 31 May 2018

The Audio-Video system is represented by a tree structure made of the
:class:`System` as root, having a list of :class:`Device` objects as branches.
Devices have then lists of :class:`Input` objects and lists of :class:`Zone` objects.

The initialisation process is separated in 3 steps:

1. Instantiate objects, load the static data from a JSON file into local attributes
   and propagate this initialisation steps to the next level, i.e. devices and then
   inputs and zones.

2. Post initialisation step, where some attributes are created based on the whole
   tree structure being already initialised in step 1.  For example, finding and
   assigning the actual object represented by a string *id* in the JSON file, is done
   here.

3. Attempt to retrieve *live* data from all the MusicCast devices
   and initialise various parameters based on this data.  In case of failure,
   the retrieval of the information is delayed and the functionality of the
   device is not available until it goes back *online*.  Beware that in this
   case some *helper* dictionaries might still point to objects that are not valid,
   so always test if a device is *ready* before proceeding using MusicCast related
   attributes.

The execution of a command is triggered by a lambda function retrieved from the
ACTIONS dictionary.
These lambda functions are methods called from a :class:`Zone` objects that
perform all the steps to execute these actions, including sending the actual
requests to the devices over HTTP (through the `musiccast_comm` module).

    This class loads the *static* data into local attributes from the JSON file.
    Some checks are performed.
    Configuration errors coming from a bad description of the system in the file are
    fatal.

    It then retrieves MusicCast parameters from the MusicCast devices through HTTP requests.
    In case of connection errors, the device concerned is put in a *not ready* state,
    and its update delayed.

    The initialisation process also starts the events listener, which is unique
    across all MusicCast devices.
