		<h1>Capital Bikeshare Member Agreement, Liability Waiver, and Release</h1>
	</header>
	
	<p>
		Capital Bikeshare is a self-serve bicycle rental system ("<u>Service</u>"), made available by Arlington County, Virginia, the District of Columbia, Montgomery County, Maryland, and the City of Alexandria (“<u>Clients</u>”) and managed by Alta Bicycle Share, Inc. ("<u>Alta</u>," "<u>Our,</u>" or "<u>We</u>"). In consideration of your use of any Service, Alta requires that you ("<u>Member</u>", "<u>You</u>", or "<u>Your</u>") agree to all terms and conditions in this User Agreement, Liability Waiver, and Release ("<u>Agreement</u>"), which are intended to promote the safe use of Capital Bikeshare bicycles, and which apply to all Registered Members and to all Casual Members, as defined below. In this Agreement, "Member" means and includes both Registered Members and Casual Members. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Section 1 <u>Modifications to Agreement</u>.</strong>
Alta, in consultation with our Clients, reserves the right to unilaterally amend, modify, or change this Agreement, at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion, without notice and without Member's consent. By continuing to use any Service after any amendment, modification, or change, Member has agreed to be bound by all such amendments, modifications, and changes. Member must carefully review this Agreement on a regular basis to maintain awareness of all amendments, modifications, and changes. Whenever a change is made to this Agreement, Alta will post a notification on <a href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">www.capitalbikeshare.com</a> ("Website"). 		
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Section 2 <u>Term of Agreement</u>.</strong>
The term of this Agreement begins when You first use any Service, and the term ends 10 years after Your last use of any Service; <u>provided</u>, <u>however</u>, that Your personal financial responsibility under Section 15 of this Agreement, titled Credit Card Matters, expires one year after the later of (i) Your last use of any Service, or (ii) the expiration of Your Membership. At any time and from time to time, and without Member's consent, Alta may unilaterally terminate Your right to use any Service, in Alta's sole discretion and without any notice or cause. This Agreement remains in full force and effect after any termination of Your right to use any Service. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Section 3 <u>Service System</u>.</strong>
		The Service is comprised of Capital Bikeshare bicycle stations ("<u>Stations</u>"), which include an automated pay station ("<u>Pay Station</u>"), and separate stands that allow the docking of Capital Bikeshare bicycles ("<u>Bike Docks</u>"). The Stations are for the purposes of the renting, docking, and locking of Capital Bikeshare bicycles, as well as the identification of the Member. Under the Service, Capital Bikeshare bicycles can be rented and returned to any Station. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Section 4 <u>Membership to Service</u>.</strong>
Member may purchase a long-term membership for the Service ("<u>Membership</u>"), which can be for a period of either one year, 30 days, or a Daily Key membership ("<u>Membership</u>").  Daily Key members will be issued a key which will activate one day memberships when used. To purchase a Membership, Member must complete a registration form and create an account ("<u>Account</u>") at www.capitalbikeshare.com ("<u>Website</u>"), to become a Registered member ("<u>Registered Member</u>"). When a Member subscribes to the Service, Alta will charge the Registered Member's credit card the amount for the Membership, as described in Section 5. Once Registered Member's credit card payment clears, Alta will mail a system key to the mailing address listed by Registered Member. Member must activate the system key on the Website, under the "Member Login" heading, before using the Service for the first time. A Membership becomes valid and active once the system key is activated on the Website. The one year and 30 days memberships allows Registered Member to use the Service without having to pay the $7 charge applicable to Casual 24-Hour Members or the $15 charge applicable to Casual 3-Day Members (definitions below), and Daily Key members will be charged the one day $7 charge for each day they activate their key; <u>provided</u>; <u>however</u>, that Registered Member must still pay the hourly rates as set forth in Section 7 for all trips in excess of 30 minutes. Within one year after a prior Membership expires, Registered Member may renew the Membership on the Website, under the "Member Login" heading. If the Membership is not renewed within this period of time, then Registered Member might need to (i) take certain actions to reactivate Registered Member's old Account, or (ii) create an entirely new Account for a new Membership. The Membership, and the personal identification number and system key related thereto, are non-transferable and may be terminated if Member breaches this Agreement, as decided by Alta in its sole discretion. If a Membership is terminated for any reason, then no refund is provided. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Section 5 <u>Registered Member Rates and Benefits</u>.</strong>

If you dispute any charge on Your Account, then you must contact Alta within 10 days of Your receipt of Your statement containing the disputed charge. Members have an on-going duty to update all changes relating to their credit card. A $101 charge will be put on the  Casual Member's credit card when a Casual Member signs up for the service at the Pay Station in order to validate the card Alta uses www.authorize.net ("Processor") as Our transaction payment processor. The transmission of data to Processor and the approval of a credit card should take less than 10 seconds; however, a credit card might not allow for an overcharge/overdraft, which means that a Member's transaction request could be denied. All denials of a transaction by a Member's bank, all holds, and all other similar issues are the Member's sole responsibility and should be dealt with between the Member and his or her bank. Alta takes reasonable steps to ensure that all data transmitted by Alta is done safely and privately; however, despite those steps, Alta cannot guarantee the complete security of all credit card and other data transmitted by Alta or Processor. Please review the DISCLAIMERS and LIMITED LIABILITY sections set forth below, which are applicable to Member's use of the Service, including the transmission of credit card and other data.
