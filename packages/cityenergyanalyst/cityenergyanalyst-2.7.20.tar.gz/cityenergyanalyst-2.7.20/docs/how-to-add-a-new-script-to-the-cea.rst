How to add a new script to the CEA
==================================

So you want to extend the CEA with a new script? This guide will get you up and running!

The main steps you need to take are:

#. copy the template script and rename it
#. update the module-level documentation and credits
#. develop your script
#. add your script to the ``cli.config`` file
#. add a section to the ``default.config`` file for any parameters your script requires
#. add an ArcGIS interface to ``cea.interfaces.arcgis.CityEnergyAnalyst.py``


Step 1: Copy the template script and rename it
----------------------------------------------

Copy the file ``cea/examples/template.py`` to a location inside the ``cea`` folder hierarchy - check other scripts
for a good place to locate it. If you need to create a subfolder, make sure you add an (empty) file called
``__init__.py`` to that folder - this makes the folder a python package and is essential for referencing the script
later on.

Rename the copied file to a name that describes your script as good as possible. You should now be able to run the
script in PyCharm (or by hand with ``python -m cea.your_package_name.your_script_name``) and get the following
output::

    Running template with scenario = C:\reference-case-open\baseline
    Running template with archetypes = ['comfort', 'architecture', 'HVAC', 'internal-loads']

Inside the ``main`` function of your script, there is a section of ``print`` statements. It is a good idea to update
this list to print out the parameters actually used by your script.

The ``main`` function in the template calls a function ``template``, passing in an ``InputLocator`` object and unpacking
the ``config`` parameter. We call this the "core" function of your script. You should definitely change the name of
the core function - ideally to the name of the script / module it resides in. The ``InputLocator`` object (by convention
called ``locator``) is used by nearly every single CEA script.

The other parameters are much more dependant on the requirements of your script. If you find yourself adding more
than a few parameters, consider just passing in the ``config`` variable instead, as long parameter lists in functions
can make your code hard to read.

Step 2: Update the module-level documentation and credits
---------------------------------------------------------

While you're at it:

- update the module-level documentation to reflect the _what_ and the _why_ of your script, including references to
  literature
- update the documentation of the core function of your script (the one called ``template`` in the template) to reflect
  the __how__ of your script
- update the credits section (near the top of the script) - be sure to change at least the following parts:
  - ``__author__`` (add your name!)
  - ``__credits__`` (add a list of names of colaborators)
  - ``__copyright__`` (update the year of the copyright for this script)


Step 3: Develop your script
---------------------------

Each script is unique. But to fit nicely into the CEA ecosystem, pay attention to the following points:

- spend some time to come up with good names for variables and functions

  - as a general rule, don't use abbreviations other than as loop indices (they're just hard to communicate later on)

    - beginners often think using short names and abreviations is "cool" - this is probably the fault of decades and
      decades of bad examples in code. There used to be a time when it mattered, but nobody uses those languages
      anymore. It's a lot easier to read real words.

  - try to use the same names for the same thing
  - make sure the names refer to the subject domain of your script (this makes the leap between literature and your
    code easier to make for anyone trying to figure out what your script does later on)
  - use plural for names referring to lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries
  - check for spelling errors (this also counts for comments) - HINT: PyCharm has a built-in automatic spellchecker much
    like the one in MS Word. If PyCharm marks any of your code in yellow or green, try to figure out why and fix it!

- don't hardcode paths! The CEA uses the ``cea.inputlocator.InputLocator`` class to define where files are. Follow this
  convention.

  - If you do need to manually create paths, use ``os.path.join(folder, ..., filename)`` instead of concatenating strings.

- if you think you need to use ``os.chdir``, you're doing it wrong!


Step 4: Add your script to the ``cli.config`` file
--------------------------------------------------

The ``cli.config`` file (located in ``cea/interfaces/cli/``) tells the ``cea`` command line program

- the name of each script in the CEA
- the module path of the script to run
- the list of parameters that the script accepts

By adding your script to the ``cli.config`` file, your script becomes executable from the command line like this::

    $ cea your-script-name --scenario C:\reference-case-open\baseline --your-parameter 123

During development of your script, you will probably not be too interested in this feature - you will probably just be
running your script from PyCharm. Please take the time to do this anyway, since it is a *requirement for adding it to
the ArcGIS interface* and other interfaces yet to come (e.g. Rhino/Grasshopper interface)

The name of your script should be the same as the module name and the core function name from
`Step 3: Develop your script`_  - except replace any underscores (``_``) with dashes (``-``).

The ``cli.config`` file has two sections: ``[scripts]`` and ``[config]``. You need to add your script to both sections,
using the script name as the key.

- in the ``[scripts]`` section, set the value to the module path of your script, that is, the path you would use to
  import your script (e.g. ``cea.examples.template``)

  - since all CEA scripts use the convention of having a ``main`` function that accepts a ``config`` object as it's
    first parameter, this allows the various interfaces (command line, ArcGIS, Rhino/Grasshopper) to  invoke the script.

- in the ``[config]`` section, set the value to the (whitespace separated) list of parameters that your script uses

  - use the notation ``section:parameter`` to specify a specific parameter defined in the ``default.config`` file.
  - use the notation ``section`` as a shorthand to specify that your script uses all the parameters from that section
    in the ``default.config`` file.
  - by defining the parameters used by the script, interfaces such as the command line, ArcGIS and Rhino/Grasshopper
    "know" what parameters to offer the user for a script.

Here is an example of the input for the template script::

    [scripts]
    template = cea.examples.template

    # ...

    [config]
    template = general:scenario data-helper


This specifies that the CEA has a script called ``template`` and that it can be found at ``cea/examples/template.py``.
This script follows the CEA convention and therefore has a function called ``main`` that is defined like this::

    def main(config):
        # contents of the main function
        # calls the core function

It also specifies that the template script uses the ``general:scenario`` parameter and all the parameters defined in
the ``data-helper`` section of the ``default.config`` file. That means, the template script can be called like this::

    $ cea template --scenario C:\reference-case-open\baseline --archetypes HVAC internal-loads


Step 5: Add a section to the ``default.config`` file for any parameters your script requires
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file ``default.config`` (found in the ``cea`` folder) specifies the list of parameters the user can set for the CEA.
This file has the same sections and parameters as the ``cea.config`` file in the user's home folder, except it also
includes additional information like parameter type and a description of the parameter.

The configuration is split up into sections. The main section ``[general]`` contains parameters that are considered
global to most scripts, e.g. ``scenario``, ``weather``, ``region``, ``multiprocessing``. All other parameters reside
in a section with the same name as the script that uses them (e.g. ``[demand]``, ``[data-helper]`` etc.) with exceptions
for tools that are closely related and share parameters (e.g. ``[solar]`` for ``photovoltaic``, ``solar-collector`` and
``photovoltaic-thermal``, ``[dbf-tools]`` for ``dbf-to-excel`` and ``excel-to-dbf``).

Follow these steps to add a new parameter for your script:

- add a section to ``default.config`` with the same name as the script or locate the appropriate section
- add a parameter name: CEA parameter names follow the naming conventions of python variable names, except they use
  kebab-case_ instead of snake_case_, i.e. dashes instead of underscores.
- set the default value
- add a line specifying the type (key: ``parameter-name.type``, value: one of the ``Parameter`` subclasses from
  ``cea.config``, e.g. ``IntegerParameter``, ``RealParameter``, ``MultiChoiceParameter``, ``PathParameter`` etc.)
- add a line specifying the documentation for the parameter (key: ``parameter-name.help``, value: the text to show in
  interfaces for that parameter - future users of your tool will be grateful for good help texts!)
- (optional) add a line specifying the category of the tool (key: ``parameter-name.category``, value: the category name)
  The category is used in the ArcGIS interface to group parameters for tools with a lot of parameters.
- (optional) add a line for tool-specific properties (e.g.: ``archetypes = comfort architecture HVAC internal-loads``)


Example::

    [data-helper]
    archetypes = comfort architecture HVAC internal-loads
    archetypes.type = MultiChoiceParameter
    archetypes.choices = comfort architecture HVAC internal-loads
    archetypes.help = List of archetypes to process

Step 6: Add an ArcGIS interface
-------------------------------

In order to include your script in the ArcGIS interface, you need to add a few lines to the file
``cea/interfaces/arcgis/CityEnergyAnalyst.py``. Since the parameters to the script have already been defined above,
You just need to create a class (call it the same as your script, but in CamelCase, adding the word ``Tool`` at the end)
and subclassing ``cea.interfaces.arcgis.CeaTool`` and set some attributes in the ``__init__`` method. Take the
``data-helper`` script, for example::

    class DataHelperTool(CeaTool):
        def __init__(self):
            self.cea_tool = 'data-helper'
            self.label = 'Data helper'
            self.description = 'Query characteristics of buildings and systems from statistical data'
            self.category = 'Data Management'
            self.canRunInBackground = False


The key differences to the definition of text-book ArcGIS tools is that you:

- subclass from ``CeaTool`` (this adds behaviour to automatically populate the parameters and execute the CEA script
  when you click ``run``)
- add the attribute ``self.cea_tool`` (setting it to the script name, use the kebab-case_ version)
- the other properties are standard

.. note:: You don't need to add your tool to the ``Toolbox.tools`` variable as you would normally need to in an
    ArcGIS python toolbox - the :py:class`cea.interfaces.arcgis.CityEnergyAnalyst.Toolbox` class already implements
    code to find all subclasses of :py:class`cea.interfaces.arcgis.arcgishelper.CeaTool` defined in the same file.
