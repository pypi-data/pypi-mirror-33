            youtube2zim [your user url or playlist url] [lang of your zim archive] [publisher]
        
        
            You can use --lowquality option that will download the video in mp4 and re-encode aggressively in webm
        == Building ==
        
        It's advised, that you have `virtualenv` installed:
        
            sudo pip install virtualenv
        
        Up next you have to create a virtual enviroment in the kiwix-other/TED/ directory for the TED Scraper:
        
            virtualenv --no-site-packages venv 
        
        Activate the virtual enviroment:
        
            source venv/bin/activate
        
        Then install youtube2zim
        
            pip install youtube2zim
        
        You will aslo need ffmpeg or avconv to convert mp4 format to webm format
        
        You also need zimwriterfs binary in this folder, zimwriterfs can be found at https://sourceforge.net/p/kiwix/other/ci/master/tree/zimwriterfs/
