reprotest (0.7.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ensure num_cpus variation uses a different number of cpus in different
    builds, and print a warning if only 1 cpu is available. (Closes: #884386)
  * Don't test the num_cpus variation if only 1 cpu is available.
  * Update to latest Standards-Version; no changes required.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Tue, 03 Oct 2017 19:25:11 +0200

reprotest (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New features:
    + Add a --auto-build option to try to determine which specific variations
      cause unreproducibility.
    + Add a --source-pattern option to restrict copying of source_root, and set
      this automatically in our presets.
  * Usability improvements:
    + Improve error messages in some common scenarios.
      - giving a source_root or build_command that doesn't exist
      - using reprotest with default settings after not installing Recommends
    + Output hashes after a successful --auto-build.
    + Print a warning message if we reproduced successfully but didn't vary
      everything.
  * Fix varying both umask and user_group at the same time.
  * Have dpkg-source extract to different build dir iff varying the build-path.
  * Pass --exclude-directory-metadata to diffoscope(1) by default as this is
    the majority use-case. Document the other cases in README and the man page.

reprotest (0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ximin Luo ]
  * Document when one should use --diffoscope-args=--exclude-directory-metadata
    and do this in our Debian package presets.
  * Bump diffoscope Recommends version to >= 84 to support this flag.
  * Import autopkgtest 4.4, with minimal patches.
  * Choose an existent HOME for the control build. (Closes: #860428)
  * Add the ability to vary the user (Closes: #872412)
  * Heavy refactoring to support > 2 builds.
  * Add a variation config language to be able to configure the specifics of
    different variations, and to make it easier to configure further builds.
  * Deprecate the --dont-vary flag, add a --vary flag for better composability.
  * Support >2 builds using the new --extra-build flag.
  * Properly sanitize artifact_pattern to avoid arbitrary shell execution.
  * Update to Standards-Version 4.1.0.

  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * Use https for the Format URI in debian/copyright.
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 10.

  [ Santiago Torres ]

reprotest (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ximin Luo ]
  * Preserve directory structure when copying artifacts. Otherwise hash output
    on a successful reproduction sometimes fails, because find(1) can't find
    the artifacts using the original artifact_pattern.

  [ Chris Lamb ]
  * Add proper release instructions and a keyring.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Tue, 09 May 2017 19:56:29 +0200

reprotest (0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * When a reproduction succeeds, only output hashes of the artifacts rather
    than everything in the current directory.
  * Remove unimplemented variations from README.
  * Rename some variations:
      path -> exec_path, to distinguish it from build_path
      faketime -> time, since users care about interface not implementation
  * Fix a bug involving --store-dir and hash output.
  * Add a --config-file option and fix the loading of configs.
  * Add a man page. (Closes: #833282)
  * Improve logging so it's properly controlled by --verbosity.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jan 2017 22:19:34 +0100

reprotest (0.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Stop advertising variations that we're not actually varying.
    That is: domain_host, shell, user_group.
  * Fix auto-presets in the case of a file in the current directory.
  * Allow disabling build-path variations. (Closes: #833284)
  * Add a faketime variation, with NO_FAKE_STAT=1 to avoid messing with
    various buildsystems. This is on by default; if it causes your builds
    to mess up please do file a bug report.
  * Add a --store-dir option to save artifacts.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Jan 2017 20:18:45 +0100

reprotest (0.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Document virtual servers and caveats better.
  * Add a --help [virtual server] option.
  * Add a --no-diffoscope option. (Closes: #844512)
  * Add a --testbed-init option to allow the user to install dependencies that
    are needed to make the variations in the first place.
  * Add an "auto" feature to the CLI, plus a presets module so it's easier to
    use, and other non-Debian systems can start populating this too.
  * Remove autopkgtest manpages and other unused files. (Closes: #834300)

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Mon, 28 Nov 2016 21:34:04 +0100

reprotest (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add a --diffoscope-arg option to pass extra args to diffoscope.

reprotest (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make some variations more reliable, so tests don't fail.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Sep 2016 22:03:30 +0200

reprotest (0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Daniel Kahn Gillmor ]
  * Add README.md to the binary package. (Closes: #834299)

  [ Ximin Luo ]
  * Support pattern matching in the build artifact, which can match more than
    one build artifact; see README.md for details on using this.
  * Add a --no-clean-on-error flag so you can analyse anything that failed or
    did not reproduce.
  * Don't fail when the build process has stderr. (Closes: #836517)
  * Fix tests, and run them during the build. disorderfs is disabled for now,
    but only when running the tests via debian/rules.

 -- Ximin Luo <infinity0@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Sep 2016 20:39:09 +0200
