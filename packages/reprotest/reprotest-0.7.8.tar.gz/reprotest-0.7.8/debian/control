Description: Build software and check it for reproducibility
 reprotest builds the same source code twice in different environments, and
 then checks the binaries produced by each build for differences. If any are
 found, then diffoscope (or if unavailable then diff) is used to display them
 in detail for later analysis.
 .
 It supports different types of environment such as a "null" environment (i.e.
 doing the builds directly in /tmp) or various other virtual servers, for
 example schroot, ssh, qemu, and several others.
 .
 reprotest is developed as part of the “reproducible builds” Debian project.
