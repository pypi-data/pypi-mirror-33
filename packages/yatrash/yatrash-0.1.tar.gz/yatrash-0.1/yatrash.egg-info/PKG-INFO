Description: # yatrash
        Safely move files into a trash can.
        
        Train yourself to use `trash` instead of `rm`.
        
        Now living on [Github][5]
        
        ## Detailed usage
        
        ```
        $ trash --help
        usage: __main__.py [-h] [--trash-dir TRASH_DIR]
                           [trash_files [trash_files ...]]
        
        ...
        see the real --help for more
        ```
        
        ## Why do we need another trash utility?
        
        This is mostly for self-educational purposes.
        
        If you actually want a trash utility, see [trash-cli][1] which
        implements the [xdg trash specification][2], so it will play nicely
        with your Desktop's trash and other tools. It also features more
        utilities, such as recover.
