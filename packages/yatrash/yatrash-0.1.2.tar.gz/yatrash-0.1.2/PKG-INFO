        =======
        
        Safely move files into a trash can instead of ``rm``.
        
        OS Independent, as long as your OS supports Python’s ``pathlib`` and
        ``shutil``.

        Detailed usage
        --------------
        
        ::
        
           $ trash --help
           usage: __main__.py [-h] [--trash-dir TRASH_DIR]
                              [trash_files [trash_files ...]]
        
           ...
           see the real --help for more
        
        Why do we need another trash utility?
        -------------------------------------
        
        This is mostly for self-educational purposes.
        
        If you actually want a trash utility, see
        `trash-cli <https://pypi.org/project/trash-cli/>`__ which implements the
        `xdg trash
        specification <http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html>`__, so it
        will play nicely with your Desktop’s trash and other tools. It also
        features more utilities, such as recover.
