        Invenio module for collecting statistics.
        
        This module provides the components for **statistical data processing and
        querying**.
        
        The most common statistics measure the occurence of events in an invenio
        application, e.g. file downloads, record views and others. Invenio-stats
        provides the tools to transform, register, compress and query those events.
        However, statistics can be fully customized and directly query the database.
        
        The services it uses are:
        
        - RabbitMQ for buffering incomming events before
        - Elasticsearch for aggregating and searching events.
        
        Further documentation is available on: https://invenio-stats.readthedocs.io/
