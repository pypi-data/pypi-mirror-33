        * `pyls-black` can either format an entire file or just the selected text.
        * The code will only be formatted if it is syntactically valid Python.
        * Text selections are treated as if they were a separate Python file.
          Unfortunately this means you can't format an indented block of code.
        * `pyls-black` will use your project's [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ambv/black#pyprojecttoml) if it has one.
