      <p>This project aim to develop and publish all modules related to the
        need of humanitarian NGOs. It would cover the overall needs in terms of
        logistics, order management, accounting, transportation and
        distribution.
      </p>

      <p>Main changes are made in the procurement standard flow of
        Odoo. Usually, you have sales that drive procurement, that drive
        purchase. With those modules, you record logistic requisition to
        capture the needs, you source them from one way or another (purchase,
        stock, donnation,..) and give back to the requestor the price, time and
        product information. If he agree with, then you confirm the requisition
        by creating an offer. The offer will drive all the necessary flow to
        deliver the good where they are needed. It also improve the purchase
        requisition flow to fit more with the NGO's problematic.</p>

      <p>In the future, it will cover other NGO's specific needs such as the
        distribution, transportation, finance (donations, donors report&hellip;),
        volonteer management&hellip;</p>
