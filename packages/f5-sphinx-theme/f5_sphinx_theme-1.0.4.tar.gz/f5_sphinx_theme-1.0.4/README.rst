===============

   :target: https://travis-ci.org/f5devcentral/f5-sphinx-theme

The f5-sphinx-theme provides F5 Networks styling and layouts for projects built with `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_. This theme should not be used without modification for any project that doesn't publish documentation to `clouddocs.f5.com <http://clouddocs.f5.com>`_.


Setup and Configuration
-----------------------
1. ``pip install f5-sphinx-theme``
2. Update your project's ``conf.py`` with the following settings: ::

    import f5_sphinx_theme
    html_theme = 'f5_sphinx_theme'
    html_sidebars = {'**': ['searchbox.html', 'localtoc.html', 'globaltoc.html']}

3. (Optional) Set the ``html_theme_options{}`` dictionary. Supported options are shown below. ::

    html_theme_options = {
                            'site_name': '<desired site name>',          \\ DEFAULTS TO "CloudDocs home"
                            'next_prev_link': True or False              \\ DEFAULTS TO FALSE
                            'html_last_updated_fmt': '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S' \\ REQUIRED FOR FEDERATED SEARCH, DO NOT CHANGE
                            'base_url' = 'http://clouddocs.f5.com'       
                         }

Depending on your publication/deployment process, you may have to re-build your documentation for the changes to take effect.
