There are several tutorials explaining different aspects of the program.

The `Getting Started tutorial <http://www.esrf.fr/computing/bliss/downloads/pymca/PyMcaCHESS.pdf>`_
is a very old tutorial written by Darren Dale and initially tailored to `CHESS <http://www.chess.cornell.edu>`_
users but usefull to everybody starting to use PyMca. In case the previous link is down, you can try
this `alternative link <https://wiki.utep.edu/display/MASE6402MME4501/PyMCA+support>`_.

:doc:`./hdf5/index` PyMca can deal with
HDF5 files since version 4.4.0. You should take a look at the
`HDF Group web site <https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/HDF5>`_ to know more about HDF.
`NeXus <http://www.nexusformat.org>`_ files are only supported when using the HDF5 backend.

`Calibration tutorial <http://www.esrf.fr/computing/bliss/downloads/pymca/calibrationtutorial.htm>`_.
To be used if you still have some doubts about how to calibrate your spectra.

:doc:`./xrf/material-definition/index`. This tutorial will show you how to define your own materials.

`ROI Imaging tutorial <http://www.esrf.fr/computing/bliss/downloads/pymca/roitooltutorial.htm>`_ .
Introduction to the stack imaging capabilities of PyMca

`Kinetics tutorial <http://www.esrf.fr/computing/bliss/downloads/pymca/kineticstutorial.htm>`_ .
Illustration of the use of the ROI Imaging tool for kinetics studies.

:doc:`./xrf/strip-background/index`. Description of the parameters defining your favorite background.

:doc:`./customization/index` Description about how to add your own add-ons to PyMca.
