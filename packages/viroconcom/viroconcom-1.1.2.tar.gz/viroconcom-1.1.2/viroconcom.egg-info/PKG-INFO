        About
        -----
        
        viroconcom is a package belonging to the software ViroCon.
        
        ViroCon helps you to design marine structures, which need to withstand
        load combinations based on wave, wind and current. It lets you define
        extreme environmental conditions with a given return period using the
        environmental contour method.
        
        The following methods are implemented in viroconcom:
        
        - Fitting a probabilistic model to measurement data using maximum likelihood estimation
        - Defining a probabilistic model with the conditonal modeling approach (CMA)
        - Computing an environmental contour using either the
        
          - inverse first-order reliability method (IFORM),
          - inverse second-order reliability method (ISORM) or the
          - highest density contour (HDC) method
        
        
        ViroCon is written in Python 3.6.4. The software is seperated in two
        main packages, viroconweb and viroconcom. This is the repository of
        viroconcom, which is the numerical core. It handles the statistical
        computations. viroconweb builds on viroconcom and is a web-based
        application with a graphical user interface. It has its own
        `repository`_.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To install the latest version of viroconcom from PyPI use
        
        .. code:: console
        
           pip install viroconcom
        
        Alternatively, you can install from viroconcom repository’s Master branch
        with
        
        .. code:: console
        
           pip install https://github.com/ahaselsteiner/viroconcom/archive/master.zip
