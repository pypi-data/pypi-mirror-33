A new menu named Export is created.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Some words are prohibeted and can't be used is the query in anyways, even in a select query :
    * delete
    * drop
    * insert
    * alter
    * truncate
    * execute
    * create
    * update

See sql_request_abstract module to fix this issue.

* checking SQL request by execution and rollback is disabled in this module
  since variables features has been introduced. This can be fixed by
  overloading _prepare_request_check_execution() function.
