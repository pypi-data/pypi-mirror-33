"""
Python module for reading data in from S60 files.  Unlike TBW or TBN data, 
the S60 data consists of only packed binary values.  Thus, the functions for 
reading in the S60 data do not return objects describing each frame but rather
return numpy arrays of the data.  The two reading functions defined are:

readFrame
  return a complex array containing the data from one UDP packet (734 samples)

readChunk
  return a complex array containing a specified number of samples, i.e., the 
  'chunk' size.

In addition to the two readers, there is also a function, getBandpassModel, 
which reads in Joe Craig's model of the S60 bandpass. See `the S60 data page <http://www.phys.unm.edu/~lwa/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=s60_data#view_and_plot_with_octave>`_
for information about the model.
