"""
Python module to handle the channelization and cross-correlation of TBW and
TBN data.  The main python functions in this module are:
  * calcSpectra - calculate power spectra for a collection of signals
  * FXCorrelator - calculate cross power spectra for a collection of signals
both of which have been deprecated in favor of the new C extension based 
routines listed below.

The main python/C extension functions in this module are:
  * SpecMaster - similar to calcSpectra but uses the _spec module for all 
    computations and does not support automatic sub-integration
  * SpecMasterP - SpecMaster with a 64-tap uniform DFT filter bank
  * FXMaster - calculate cross power spectra for a collection of signals

Each function is set up to process the signals in parallel using the 
multiprocessing module and accepts a variety of options controlling the processing
of the data, including various window functions and time averaging.
