"""
Python module to handle the channelization and cross-correlation of TBW and
TBN data.  The main python functions in this module are:
  * calcSpectra - calculate power spectra for a collection of signals
  * FXCorrelator - calculate cross power spectra for a collection of signals
  * FXStokes - calculate Stokes cross power spectra for a collection of signals
both of which have been deprecated in favor of the new C extension based 
routines listed below.

The main python/C extension functions in this module are:
  * SpecMaster - similar to calcSpectra but uses the _spec module for all 
    computations and does not support automatic sub-integration
  * SpecMasterP - SpecMaster with a 64-tap uniform DFT filter bank
  * StokesMaster - similar to SpecMaster but computes all four Stokes parameters
  * FXMaster - calculate cross power spectra for a collection of signals

Each function is set up to process the signals in parallel using the 
multiprocessing module and accepts a variety of options controlling the processing
of the data, including various window functions and time averaging.

	Given a collection of time series data with inputs on the first dimension
	and data on the second, compute the spectra for all inputs.  By default, 
	all data in the time series are average into a single spectrum.  However, this 
	behavior can be modified if the SampleAverage keyword is set.  SampleAverage 
	specifies how many individual spectra of length LFFT are to be averaged.

	.. versionchanged:: 0.3.4
		Prior to LSL version 0.3.4, the window functions available for calcSpectra 
		were limited to Blackman and an (untested) Polyphase filter.  With version
		0.4.0, the window to be used is passed to the function call via the 'window'
		keyword and an "empty" window is provided by the module.  This allows for
		the various window function defined in numpy (i.e., bartlett, blackman, 
		hamming, etc.) to be used.  It also makes it easier to filter the data using
		a custom window.  For example, a Kaiser window with a shape factor of 5 
		could be made with:
			
			>>> import numpy
			>>> def newWindow(L):
			...      return numpy.kaiser(L, 5)
