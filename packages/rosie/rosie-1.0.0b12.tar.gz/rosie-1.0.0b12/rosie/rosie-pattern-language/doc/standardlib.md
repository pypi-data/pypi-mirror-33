# Rosie Standard Library

The RPL "standard library" is bundled with Rosie and contains many pre-defined
patterns.  As part of each Rosie release, the version of the library is the
version of the Rosie release.

You can find the version using the Rosie `version` command.

_Forthcoming_


For now, please read the RPL files that define the standard library.  They are
in the Rosie distribution in the `rpl` directory.  Understanding those patterns
is a good step towards seeing how Rosie is used, and how to write your own
patterns.


<!-- The only patterns that are truly built-in are: -->

<!-- `.` (dot) -->
<!-- `$` (dollar sign) -->
<!-- `^` (caret) -->
<!-- `~` (boundary) -->

<!-- Often, you'll want to build your patterns by starting with some of the ones in Rosie's standard library (found in the `rpl` directory where Rosie is installed). -->
