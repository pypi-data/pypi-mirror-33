        ### Install
        
        ```Bash
        
        git clone https://github.com/rtnx/xtheme
        cd xtheme
        pip install --user .
        
        ```
        
        ### Themes
        
        Theme files are in `toml` format. There's no requirements for them,
        they are there for you to set variable that will be used later in generators.
        
        ### Generators
        
        Generators include:
        
        + template.jinja2 - template for config file using variables from theme.
        + config.toml     - configuration file.
        + pre-apply.sh    - script executed before applying theme
        + post-apply.sh   - script executed after applying theme.
        
        config.toml:
        
        ```Toml
        
        [config]
        
          name = 'i3'
          target = '/home/rtgnx/.i3/config' # target file to which template is rendered
        
        ```
