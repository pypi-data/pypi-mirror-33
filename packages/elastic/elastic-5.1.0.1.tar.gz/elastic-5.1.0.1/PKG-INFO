        Elastic is a set of python routines for calculation of elastic
        properties of crystals (elastic constants, equation of state, sound
        velocities, etc.). It is a third version of the in-house code I have
        written over few years and is implemented as a extension to the
        `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__ system. The code was a basis
        for some of my publications and was described briefly in these papers.
        The code was available to anyone, presented at the 
        `Workshop on ab initio Calculations in Geosciences <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/workshop/work2008/>`__ 
        and used by some of my co-workers. This code is a re-implementation
        of elastic as a module for the ASE.
        
        The on-line documentation is placed on
        `ReadTheDocs <http://elastic.rtfd.org/>`__ or 
        `Elastic website <http://wolf.ifj.edu.pl/elastic/>`__. You can obtain the
        `documentation as a PDF file <https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/elastic/stable/elastic.pdf>`__
        as well.
        
        The docs are also published at: 
        `Elastic over IPFS <https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSHUr59SLvWEZq7URTDGgouVaq7vFJYG7HqtBgL4s6M2u/>`__

        Installation 
        -------------
        
        The installation is simple if you are using conda package menager:
        
        ::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge elastic
        
        If you need a more elaborate 
        `installation instruction <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jochym/qe-doc/blob/master/Installation.ipynb>`__
        for computing environment to work with ASE - I have written just such a
        document. It is a first in the series of tutorials of this subject and
        you can find it under nbviewer link above.
        
        The project is open and I welcome patches, ideas and other feedback.
