Description: 
            A basic python interface to the inverse adding-doubling package written
            in C by Scott Prahl.  This allows users to extract the intrinisic optical 
            properties of materials from measurements of total reflected and total 
            transmitted light.
            
            The original adding-doubling was developed by van de Hulst to model light
            propagation through layered media.  It was extended to handle Fresnel 
            reflection at boundaries as well as interactions with integrating spheres. 
            Finally, the code was further extended to handle lost light by including 
            Monte Carlo techniques.
