POS Customer Display
====================

This module adds support for Customer Display in the Point of Sale. This
module is designed to be installed on the *main Odoo server*. On the
*POSbox*, you should install the module *hw_customer_display*.

The number of rows and cols of the Customer Display (usually 2 x 20)
should be configured on the main Odoo server, in the menu Point of Sale
> Configuration > Point of Sales.

It has been tested with a Bixolon BCD-1100
(http://www.bixolon.com/html/en/product/product_detail.xhtml?prod_id=61),
but should support most serial and USB-serial LCD displays
out-of-the-box, cf the module *hw_customer_display* for more info.

This module has been developped during a POS code sprint at Akretion
France from July 7th to July 10th 2014. This module is part of the POS
project of the Odoo Community Association http://odoo-community.org/.
You are invited to become a member and/or get involved in the
Association !
