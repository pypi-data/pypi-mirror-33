Helper method to turn the click.progressbar into a Pacman!


* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

Same interface as `click.progressbar` (http://click.pocoo.org/6/utils/#showing-progress-bars), just use `pacbar`.

Made mostly for my personal use, so use at your own risk. Enjoy!

.. code-block:: python

    import time

    from pacbar import pacbar

    with pacbar(range(10)) as bar:
    for x in bar:
            time.sleep(1)
