Description: # q2
        
        A reinforcement learning framework and command line tool.
        
        
        ## Get it
        
        ```
        pip install q2
        q2 --help
        ```
        
        ## Use it
        
        Make a folder, `cd` to it, then run
        
        ```
        q2 init
        ```
        
        to generate a new reinforcement learning project.
        
        ## Docs
        
        Documentation is available at https://q2.readthedocs.io/.
        
        
        ## Develop
        
         
        0. You'll need Python >= 3.5 (this is because q2 makes use of type annotations)
        1. Clone this repository
        2. I recommend setting up a virtual env in which to develop: `python -m venv env`
        3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        
        To test out the command line tools from your working copy of q2, run
        
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        then run
        
        ```
        q2 --help
        ```
        
        to test that it worked.
