    upgrade: ['Nodepool can now support multiple node labels, although the OpenStack
        and

        static node drivers do not yet support specifying multiple labels, so this

        is not yet a user-visible change. This does, however, require shutting down

        all launcher processes before restarting them. Running multiple launchers

        with mixed support of multi-label will cause errors, so a full shutdown is

        required.
