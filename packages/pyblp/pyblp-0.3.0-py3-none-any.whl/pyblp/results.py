class Results(object):
    r"""Results of a solved BLP problem.

    Many results are class attributes. Other post-estimation outputs be computed by calling class methods.

    Most class method have a `processes` argument, which determines the number of Python processes that will be used
    when computing a post-estimation output. By default, multiprocessing will not be used. For values greater than one,
    a pool of that many Python processes will be created. Market-by-market computation of the post-estimation output
    will be distributed among these processes. Using multiprocessing will only improve computation speed if gains from
    parallelization outweigh overhead from creating the process pool.
