        =============
        ConfigUpdater
        =============
        
        WORK IN PROGRESS!
        
        The sole purpose of ``ConfigUpdater`` is to easily update an INI config file
        with no changes to the original file except the intended ones. This means
        comments, the ordering of sections and key/value-pairs as wells as their
        case are kept as in the original file. Thus ``ConfigUpdater`` provides
        complementary functionality to Python's `ConfigParser`_ which is primarily
        meant for reading config files and writing new ones.
        
        Differences
        ===========
        
        The key differences to ``ConfigParser`` are:
        
        * inline comments are treated as part of a key's value,
        * the original case of sections and keys are kept,
        * control over the position of a new section/key
        
        Following features are **deliberately not** implemented:
        
        * interpolation of values,
        * propagation of parameters from the default section,
        * conversions of values,
        * non-strict mode allowing duplicate sections and keys,
        
        
        Note
        ====
        
        ``ConfigUpdater`` is mainly developed for http://pyscaffold.org/.
