This module adds a new field on the partner form in the *Accouting* tab:
*Customer Create Invoice*. The value of this field will be used when you
create a new Sale Order with this partner as customer.

Beware that this module depends not only on *sale*, but also on *stock*.
As there is only one create invoice method when the *stock* module is not
installed, you should not install this module if the *stock* module is not
installed.
