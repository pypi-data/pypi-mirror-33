Notes on deleted stuff:

There were three files, each an exploration into using hdf5, I assume
 - hdf5_archive: I believe I was converting klepto._archive to use hdf5
 - mpi4py_h5py: I believe was tutorial test code for using mpi4py and hdf5
 - __reduce_in_closure__: ???

Not sure what the last one did, but I do remember starting an exploration
into using stackless's API to serialize iterators and the like.  It may
have been that.
