    "So now that PmagPy has made the conversion to python3, for at least a short time the command line programs will be supported in both Python2 and Python3 using the library future which can be installed by in your favorite package manager (canopy, anaconda) or using this code in the command line `pip install future`. This is not true for the GUIs, however, which due to their dependency on the wxpython library must be in one language or the other. For the sake of future proofing the library all GUI related code needs to be in Python3 as soon many of the scientific libraries (ipython, matplotlib, pandas) required by PmagPy are dropping support for Python2. A full list of libraries dropping support for Python2 by 2020 can be found [here](http://www.python3statement.org/).\n",

    "One of the most unnoticed and important changes between Python2 and Python3 is the difference in Strings and how they are encoded. **Def:** encoding - the manner in which the bits are organized to represent a given piece of information to the computer, in this case string characters. Python2 used ASCII strings by default and had a class Unicode, where as Python3 uses Unicode as the main string class (str) and has two other string classes byte and bytearray which are used to represent binary data. This mostly causes a problem in PmagPy when reading binary data using open(file,'b') as it will now be read in as a byte object which cannot be manipulated like a string. This can be seen in the 2G binary conversion script in the programs directory. This can also be a problem when using libraries like json as the library may read in using a different encoding like ASCII and need to be decoded to turn into the correct string. An example of this can be seen in data_model3 in the pmagpy directory. This is rather case by case and something only occasionally run into, hopefully the work arounds in data_model3 and the 2G binary conversion script can help you overcome most of these issues."

    "This difference brings up a conversation on the 3 different types of objects which contains sets of data as they can be found in both Python2 and Python3: generators, lists, and tuples. Generators are objects which have a current state and a defined next operation (i.e. x=0, x+1) this allows you to define infinite sets or large sets without storing all the data in memory. Lists are built-in arrays which contain each piece of data in RAM and can access them as requested by the user (i.e. [0,2,3,4,5]), most importantly lists are mutable so their values can be changed even in different namespaces than they were created. Tuples are nearly identical to lists, however, they are imutable and they must be recreated to change even a single value. This distinction is more important in Python3 than Python2 as many of the data types returned from the built-in functions above are decended from the generator class or the tuple class instead of just returning a list as Python2 does. Here are some examples of a basic generator, list, and tuple."
