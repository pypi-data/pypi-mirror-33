Description: Ca2Spike
        ========
        
        Deconvolve calcium imaging data to spikes. A wrapper around Chenkov and
        McColgan so itâ€™s easier to use their model and weights. Assuming you
        have a imageJ roi measurement csv file, and a known sample_rate of your
        two photon recording:
        
        .. code:: python
        
           import numpy as np
           from ca2spike import deconvolve
           calcium_data = np.genfromtxt(file_path, delimiter=',')[1:, 1::4].T
           spike_data, timestamps, new_sample_rate = deconvolve(data, sample_rate)
        
        Here the new sample rate is just a rounded int, coz otherwise your
        analysis experience will suck.
