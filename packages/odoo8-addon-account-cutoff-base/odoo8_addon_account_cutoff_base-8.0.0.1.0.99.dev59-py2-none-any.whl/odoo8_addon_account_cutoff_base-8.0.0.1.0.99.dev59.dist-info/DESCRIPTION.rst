This module contains objets, fields and menu entries that are used by other
cut-off modules. So you need to install other cut-off modules to get the
additionnal functionalities :

* the module *account_cutoff_prepaid* will manage prepaid cut-offs based on
  start date and end date,
* the module *account_cutoff_accrual_picking* will manage the accruals based
  on the status of the pickings.
