Description: # Chaturanga
        
        Chaturanga is a Chess API written in Python that supports two-player games.
        
        As of now, the Chessboard supports input in a (start, stop) format to make a move.
        
        Functionality includes:
        * Chessboard generation from a given valid FEN position
        * Pretty print of the Chessboard using Unicode (optional, defaults to False)
        * Generation of all legal moves for a given position. (including en-passant, castling, and promotion)
        * Identifying potential draw situations (3-fold repitition, 100 plies) and checks.
        * Identification of all game ending criteria (Checkmate, Stalemate, 5-fold repitition, 150 plies)
        * Undoing a move
        * Resetting the Chessboard
        
        A Chess bot using depth analysis is under construction.
