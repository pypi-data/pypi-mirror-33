Description: A enterprise framework for developing true enterprise python applications
        ===============================================================================
        This project is designed to make building python applications to be used in enterprise systems.
        There are many frameworks that exist for creating python web applications and/or APIs using python.  However,
        the needs of enterprise level applications are often not met by these frameworks. Namely:
        
        * API level calls for all operations
        * CLI to perform automated/scripting tasks against the application
        
        PyLegos borrows many of the concepts used by other application frameworks.  The framework is somewhat opinionated.  It
        currently requires a particular file structure.  In future releases we hope to eliminate this requirement so that the
        structure can be adjusted to meet the style of the development team.
