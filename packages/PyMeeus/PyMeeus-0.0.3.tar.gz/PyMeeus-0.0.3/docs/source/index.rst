Welcome to PyMeeus's documentation!
===================================

Library of astronomical algorithms in Python
--------------------------------------------

PyMeeus is a Python implementation of the astronomical algorithms described in
the classical book *Astronomical Algorithms, 2nd Edition (1998)* from Jean
Meeus.

There are great astronomical libraries out there. For instance, if you're
looking for high precision and speed you should take a look at
`libnova <http://libnova.sourceforge.net/>`_.

However, the advantages of PyMeeus are:

    - its simplicity
    - ease of use
    - ease of reading
    - ease of installation (it has the minimum amount of dependencies)
    - abundant documentation

and it is written in Python!!! :-)
