Medusa - Analysis of ensembles of metabolic network reconstructions
===================================================================

|Build Status| |PyPI|

Medusa is a tool for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) of ensembles. It builds on the cobrapy package (https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy) by extending most single-model functionality to efficient ensemble-scale analysis. Additionally, Medusa provides novel functions for the analysis of ensembles.

Medusa is developed openly. We are currently porting code from previous/in-progress projects to generalize beyond the specific use cases that project code was originally developed for. Development plans can be found in the root of the repository in "version_release_plan.txt".


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use pip to install medusa from PyPI::

    pip install medusa-cobra


Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Medusa can be loaded in python with::

    import medusa




Resources
~~~~~~~~~

We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with standard COBRA methods in the cobrapy package (https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy)
