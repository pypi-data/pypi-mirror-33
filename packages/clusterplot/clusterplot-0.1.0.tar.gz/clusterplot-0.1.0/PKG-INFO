Description: Clusterplot
        ===========
        **clusterplot** is a python tool to recognise trends in datasets. It uses different clustering algorithms on >=2-dimensional network histograms. 
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        For the start, have a look in the examples/ directory. Execute the mkfiles.py:
        >>> python3 mkfiles.py
        This will create 660 files in a subdirectory data/. Each file contains sine or cosine curves with a random period.
        Two packets of sine functions with 20 files each have the same period within the packet. The periods can be seen in the file randinfo.txt. The set up goal for clusterplot is to identify the two sine periods, that occur more often.
        Next, execute (step by step) the file xample.py:
        >>>python3 xample.py
        This should get you a basic idea of how Clusterplot works.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        - numpy
