Description
===========

I'm CÃ©dric ROMAN.

``ngoschema`` aims at building classes based on a `JSON schema
<https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/index.html>`_.

User can declare its attributes in a schema (along with their type, default
value) and the class will be built with accessors to check and validate data.

User can add methods and override setters/getters, but the library provides a
boiler plate to automatically create the class, nicely instrumented (with loggers,
exception handling, type checking, data validation, etc...).

Objects created are come with managers to load/save them into files.

Serialization tools are provided that can be used to do code generation.

The library is build on top of `python-jsonschema-object
<https://github.com/cwacek/python-jsonschema-objects>`_, with a lot of hacking,
which allows to create classes
from a JSON-schema.

Both projects use the library `python-jsonchema
<http://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/>`_, a python
implementation for JSON schema validation.
