Schemas
=======

The library intends to deal with complex schemas, possibly using
inheritance which is not yet supported in JSON Schema, as well as
data types which can be useful in generated class.

For this purpose, a meta-schema is built on top of the standard ones, adding specific features, but which won't be recognized by
standard validators. Though, the schema valid against this meta-schema should usually be processed without problem by standard validation libraries (with warnings for the unknow field)
with the exception
