Description: M.A.T.A (Medieval Attack-Trade-Alliance)
        ========================================
        
        For my HSC major project, I am creating a simple 2D game engine that
        allows developers to easily create multiplayer games which utilise
        either a local network or an Internet connection. The engine can be used
        to create singleplayer games, but is created with the multiplayer
        experience in mind.
        
        Automatic Setup:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To test the engine, you should only need python installed (Python 3.4 is
        the best). Then, in a Terminal, Powershell or Command Prompt window,
        run: > py launcher.py
        
        Use the command line arguments detailed at the bottom of this readme to
        control the game's behaviour.
        
        Manual Setup:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If for some reason, the launcher does not work, the sample game can be
        launched manually by following a few steps. Firstly, ensure that your
        computer has the following dependencies installed:
        
        Windows
        '''''''
        
        Required:
                 
        
        -  Python 3 (3.4 is preferred)
        -  `Visual Studio C++ Build
           Tools <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers>`__ (Not needed
           for Python 3.4)
        
        Linux:
        ''''''
        
        Required:
                 
        
        -  python3
        
        Optional:
                 
        
        -  python3-dev
        -  cython3
        
        Required Python3 Packages (installed using pip3):
                                                         
        
        -  pygame
        -  noise
        
        The next step is to compile or pythonify the api (instructions in the
        api folder README).
        
        Then, just run the main.py file in the Python interpreter.
        
        Using the Engine:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use the engine as a game development framework, the simplest method
        is to install the mata package from PyPI. This can be done using: > py
        -m pip install mata
        
        on Windows, or using: > pip3 install mata
        
        on Linux and Mac OS.
        
        Creating a New Project:
        '''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        Creating a new project is simply a case of using the
        mata\_create\_project command (added after installation of the mata
        package from PyPI).
