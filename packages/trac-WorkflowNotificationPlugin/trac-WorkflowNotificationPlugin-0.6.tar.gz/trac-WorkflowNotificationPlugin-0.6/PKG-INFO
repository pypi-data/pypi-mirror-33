        ----------------
        
         * Configuring notifications through Trac's web admin system now requires
           TICKET_ADMIN only, not full TRAC_ADMIN.  This permission check is also
           FineGrainedPermissions-aware.
         * Notification templates can now access a `change_history` variable to email
           all commenters on a ticket, display a full history of ticket changes in
           the email body, and other use cases.
