Many people have contributed to lmfit.  The attribution of credit in a project
such as this is very difficult to get perfect, and there are no doubt important
contributions missing or under-represented here.  Please consider this file as
part of the documentation that may have bugs that need fixing.

Some of the largest and most important contributions (approximately in order of
contribution in size to the existing code) are from:

  Matthew Newville wrote the original version and maintains the project.

  Till Stensitzki wrote the improved estimates of confidence intervals, and
  contributed many tests, bug fixes, and documentation.

  Renee Otten wrote the brute force method, implemented basin-hopping and AMPGO
  global solvers, and has greatly improved the code, testing, and documentation
  and overall project.

  A. R. J. Nelson added differential_evolution, emcee, and greatly improved the
  code, docstrings, and overall project.

  Antonino Ingargiola wrote much of the high level Model code and has provided
  many bug fixes and improvements.

  Daniel B. Allan wrote much of the original version of the high level Model
  code, and many improvements to the testing and documentation.

  Austen Fox fixed many of the built-in model functions and improved the
  testing and documentation of these.

  Michal Rawlik added plotting capabilities for Models.

  J. J. Helmus wrote the MINUT bounds for leastsq, originally in
  leastsqbounds.py, and ported to lmfit.

  E. O. Le Bigot wrote the uncertainties package, a version of which was used
  by lmfit for many years, and is now an external dependency.


Additional patches, bug fixes, and suggestions have come from Christoph Deil,
Francois Boulogne, Thomas Caswell, Colin Brosseau, nmearl, Gustavo Pasquevich,
Clemens Prescher, LiCode, Ben Gamari, Yoav Roam, Alexander Stark, Alexandre
Beelen, and many others.

The lmfit code obviously depends on, and owes a very large debt to the code in
scipy.optimize.  Several discussions on the scipy-user and lmfit mailing lists
have also led to improvements in this code.
