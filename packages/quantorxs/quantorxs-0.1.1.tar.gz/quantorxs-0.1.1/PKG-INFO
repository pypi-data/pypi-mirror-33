Description: QUANTORXS : QUANTification of ORganics by X-ray Spectrosocopy
        =============================================================
        
        QUANTORXS is an open-source program to automatically analyze XANES
        spectra at Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen K-edges edges to quantify the
        concentration of functional groups and the elemental ratios (N/C and
        O/C). It is based on a novel quantification method published in
        `Analytical
        chemistry <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00689>`__.
        
        QUANTORXS performs the following tasks automatically:
        
        -  Load the data from the file(s)
        -  Remove background
        -  Normalize the spectra
        -  Generate a model of the fine structure a fit it to the experimental
           data
        -  Calculate the functional groups abundances and elemental rations from
           the results of the fit
        -  Generate an Excel file and multiple figures with the results and
           normalised spectra files.
        
        This is illustrated in more detail in the following diagram:

        QUANTORXS is designed to work without any user input other than the
        experimental spectra. Users willing to modify the details of the
        quantification can download the code from its `GitHub
        repository <https://github.com/CorentinLG/QuantORXS>`__.
        
        The code was initially written by `Corentin Le
        Guillou <http://umet.univ-lille1.fr/detailscomplets.php?id=505&lang=fr>`__.
        `Francisco de la
        Peña <http://umet.univ-lille1.fr/detailscomplets.php?id=614&lang=fr>`__
        created the command line and graphical user interfaces.
        
        Installing QUANTORXS.
        ---------------------
        
        QUANTORXS is written in the Python programming languague and is
        available from `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/quantorxs>`__. It runs in
        any operating system with the Python programming language installed.
        
        To install QUANTORXS execute the following in a terminal:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install quantorxs
        
        Step-by-step installation instructions for Windows users
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        If you are new to Python we reccomend you to install the opensource and
        free `Anaconda Python
        distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__ for your platform
        first. Afterwards, from the Microsoft Windows ``Start Menu``, open
        “anaconda prompt” as in the image below:
        
        .. figure:: https://github.com/CorentinLG/QuantORXS/raw/master/Images/Anaconda_prompt.jpg
           :alt: where to find anaconda prompt
        
           Alt text
        
        Then type the following and press ``Enter`` (requires connection to the
        internet):
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install quantorxs
        
        .. figure:: https://github.com/CorentinLG/QuantORXS/raw/master/Images/Install_command_line.jpg
           :alt: The install command line
        
           Alt text
        
        That’s all! QUANTORXS should now be installed in your system.
        
        Starting the QUANTORXS Graphical User Interface
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        To start the graphical interface execute the ``quantorxs_gui`` e.g. a
        terminal. Alternatively, Windows users can start it by searching for the
        executable file “quantorxs_gui” in the ``Start Menu`` and launching it
        as shown in the image below.

        How to use the graphical interface
        ----------------------------------
        
        The program is designed to process several spectra at once. All source
        spectra should be assembled in one folder. QUANTORXS reads only the
        format produced by
        `aXis2000 <http://unicorn.mcmaster.ca/aXis2000.html>`__
        
        -  Click on the ``Choose data directory`` button and select the folder
           containing the source spectra.
        -  Type in an output folder name (relative to the data directory) to
           store the results of the analysis. The default is
           ``QUANTORXS results``.
        -  Make sure that the ``demo`` box is not checked. If checked, it uses
           default files as input to produce an example of the output files.
        -  Select the format of the figure output (the default is SVG)
        -  Set the ``offset`` if required to compensate from any energy
           misalignment (e.g. from poorly calibrated monochromator) *common to
           all spectra*.
        -  Click the ``Run`` button and wait until the analysis is completed
           (usually a few secondes per spectrum).

        Description of the output files
        -------------------------------
        
        The output folder will be created in the folder from which the data have
        been taken. An .xls result file and two different sub-folders are
        created:
        
        a .xls file contains several sheets:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  The fitting parameters
        -  The quantified data (aromatic, ketones, aliphatics, carboxylics; as
           well as N/C and O/C ratios) and some related plots
        -  The spectra at the C-K edge normalized by the area ratio method
        -  The spectra at the N-K edge normalized by the area ratio method
        -  The spectra at the O-K edge normalized by the area ratio method
        -  The fitted heights of the Gaussians for the area-based normalization
           at the C-K edge
        -  The fitted heights of the Gaussians for the area-based normalization
           at the N-K edge
        -  The fitted heights of the Gaussians for the area-based normalization
           at the O-K edge
