How to release
==============

Versioning
----------

You might want to install ``bumpversion``, so that you can run something like:

* ``bumpversion --allow-dirty --new-version 0.2.5 patch``.

The above version value must agree with the variables ``version`` and ``release`` present in the ``conf.py`` under the `docs` folder.


PyInstaller
-----------

For the `BAG_<tool>.1file.spec` files, you need to verify that the following parameters are passed to the ``EXE()`` function:

* ``console=False``: to avoid that a console window is opened at run-time for standard I/O
* ``debug=False``: to avoid that the boot-loader issues progress messages while initializing and starting the bundled app
