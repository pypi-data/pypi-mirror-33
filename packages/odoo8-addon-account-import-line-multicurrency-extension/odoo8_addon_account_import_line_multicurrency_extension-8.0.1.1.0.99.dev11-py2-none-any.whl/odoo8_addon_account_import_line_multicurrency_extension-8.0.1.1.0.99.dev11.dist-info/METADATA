Account Import Line Multi Currency Extension
============================================

* Improve the view of the import invoice wizard in the bank statement form in order to display more relevant columns. Especially if you work in multi-currency and handle partial payment.

* A column 'Journal currency symbol' has been added just after the amount column to avoid confusion from end-users -> When the bank journal is in foreign currency then the amount column must be filled in that currency.

* When importing lines in currencies amount, amount currency and currency are now correctly handled

A check has been added when pressing 'Reconcile' button: no zero amount are accepted. (since it is obviously an user error)


The following feature have been moved in `bank_statement_import_invoices_fix`
* When lines are imported the reference goes to the communication field (instead of reference of the bank statement line) in order to have a default proposal from the system during the reconciliation process.


Configuration
=============
