def system_norm(G, p=np.inf, hinf_tol=1e-6, eig_tol=1e-8):
    """
    Computes the system p-norm. Currently, no balancing is done on the
    system, however in the future, a scaling of some sort will be introduced.
    Currently, only H₂ and H∞-norm are understood.

    For H₂-norm, the standard grammian definition via controllability grammian,
    that can be found elsewhere is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : {State,Transfer}
        System for which the norm is computed
    p : {int,np.inf}
        The norm type; `np.inf` for H∞- and `2` for H2-norm
    hinf_tol: float
        When the progress is below this tolerance the result is accepted
        as converged.
    eig_tol: float
        The algorithm relies on checking the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
        being on the imaginary axis or not. This value is the threshold
        such that the absolute real value of the eigenvalues smaller than
        this value will be accepted as pure imaginary eigenvalues.

    Returns
    -------
    n : float
        Resulting p-norm

    Notes
    -----
    The H∞ norm is computed via the so-called BBBS algorithm ([1]_, [2]_).
