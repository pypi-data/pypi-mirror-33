Description: # PlotDigitizer
        
        Python3 app to digitize plot (Under developement)
        
        # Flow
        
        1. Remove all the text from the image. Only axis and plot should be left.
        
        ![](./figures/original.png)
        
        Should be converted to 
        
        ![](./figures/trimmed.png)
        
        2. Then we run the script like this.
        
        ```
        ./plotdigitizer.py -i ./figures/trimmed.png -d 0,0 -d 10,0 -d 0,1
        ```
        
        Option `-i` accepts the input file. The important bit is repeating `-d` options.
        These are the data-points. We need at least 3 of them. In this example, we are
        telling the script that I am going to click on 3 points on the image
        respectively.  These clicks will map to those 3 data-points. Make sure to click
        them in order. 
        
        __IMP:__ Left bottom corner of the  image is `(0,0)`. 
        
        Once you have clicked on these points, the algorithm will run and extract the
        trajectory. 
        
        Currently this script has following limitations 
        
        - Background must not be transparent. Might work with transparent background but
          I've not tested it.
        - One image should have only one trajectory.
