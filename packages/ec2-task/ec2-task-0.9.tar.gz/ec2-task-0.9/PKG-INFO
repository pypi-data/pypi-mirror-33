Description: ec2_task
        =================
        
        Enabling easy start, running of tasks and stopping of EC2 instances in AWS.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        * Python3 (>=3.4)
        
        
        ### Usage
        
            $ pip install ec2-task
        
        Add your AWS credentials and details of your EC2 instance in config file e.g. aws_config.ini.
        The aws_config file should have the following:
        
            [aws]
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            INSTANCE_ID=
            REGION=
            KEY_PATH=<path to aws key file for ssh>
            USER=<user e.g. ubuntu>
        
        List of tasks should be added as a separate file (containing mainly shell commands) e.g. task.sh.
        
            >>> from ec2_task import connect_ec2
            >>> ec2_instance = connect_ec2.Ec2Instance(config_file="aws_config.ini") # include the path of your aws config file
            >>> ec2_instance.start_instance()
            >>> ec2_instance.run_task(task_file="task.sh") # include the path of your task file
            >>> ec2_instance.stop_instance()
            
        Check example in the Github repository.
