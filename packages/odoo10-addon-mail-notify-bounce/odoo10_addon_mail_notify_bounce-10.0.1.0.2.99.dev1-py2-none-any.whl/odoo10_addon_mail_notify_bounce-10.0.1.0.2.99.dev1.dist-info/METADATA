====================
Notify bounce emails
====================

In case of bounced email messages retrieved by fetchmail, sender of original message will be notified. Also, it is possible to configure email addresses to be notified about bounced emails.

Typical use case:

 - User configures a partner with a wrong email address
 - User sends a message to that partner
 - User gets notified about wrong email address

In some cases (see `https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/21119
<https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/21119>`_.), these messages are silently discarded by odoo, so users don't know about possible failures.
Also, even when bounce messages are correctly fetched by odoo, the sender, or other people, will not be notified.

Configuration
=============

To configure additional recipients of bounced emails, you can open fetchmail server form and fill 'Notify bounce emails to' field
