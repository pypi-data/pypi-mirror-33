`OGR <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/FAQGeneral#WhatdoesOGRstandfor>`_
used to stand for OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation. However,
since OGR is not fully compliant with the OpenGIS Simple Feature specification
and is not approved as a reference implementation of the spec the name was
changed to OGR Simple Features Library. The only meaning of OGR in this name is
historical. OGR is also the prefix used everywhere in the source of the library
for class names, filenames, etc.

Interesting, right?
