        Python Client library for StoryBoard
        
        This is the StoryBoard python client! It lets you interact with
        StoryBoard from the comfort of your own terminal! There is no
        command to run this; instead you can import it into scripts. This
        lets you perform complex actions on things in StoryBoard, eg: add an
        helpful comment on all stories with 'cannot store contact information'
        in the description, pointing users at the relevant docs, but only
        if there is no comment to this effect already. (There is an example
        of such a script in the documentation.)
        
        Happy task-tracking!
