AccaSim: HPC Simulator for Workload Management 
==============================================

*current version:* |version|

AccaSim is a Workload management [sim]ulator for [H]PC systems, useful for developing dispatchers and conducting controlled experiments in HPC dispatching research. It is scalable and highly customizable, allowing to carry out large experiments across different workload sources, resource settings, and dispatching methods.

AccaSim enables users to design novel advanced dispatchers by exploiting information regarding the current system status, which can be extended for including custom behaviors such as power consumption and failures of the resources. The researchers can use AccaSim for instance to mimic any real system by setting up the synthetic resources suitably, develop advanced power-aware, fault-resilient dispatching methods, and test them over a wide range of workloads by generating them synthetically or using real workload traces from HPC users.
