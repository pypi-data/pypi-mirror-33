===================================
Stock Orderpoint Manual Procurement
===================================

This module allows users to manually start procurements from the list of
reordering rules, based on the quantity that is recommended to be procured.

Usage
=====

Go to 'Inventory > Inventory Control > Reordering Rules' and review the
quantity recommended to be procured. You can now start the procurement for a
single or a list of reordering rules.

The recommended quantity to procure is adjusted to the procurement unit of
measure indicated in the reordering rule.

If you want users to be able to change the recommended quantity to procure,
you should assign them to the security group 'Change quantity in manual
procurements from reordering rules', under 'Settings / Users / Users'.
