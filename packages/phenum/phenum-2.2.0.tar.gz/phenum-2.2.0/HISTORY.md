# Revision History for "phonon-enumeration"

## Revision 2.2.0
- Changed the config_id convention for the `cfg` again.
- Moved `makeStr.py` to `phenumStr.py`.

## Revision 2.1.5
- Fixed the config_id in the `cfg` files.

## Revision 2.1.4
- Fixed a bug in which the enumeration was freezing because it wrongly
  entering the guess and check method when it shouldn't by changing
  the checks and implementing the multinomial.
- Fixed a bug in which makestry wasn't parsing the all string
  properly.

## Revision 2.1.3
- Fixed the hash function in `makeStr.py`.

## Revision 2.1.2
- Fixed bugs in `write_POSCAR` and `write_config` that were introduced
  by the merge and by the need to maintain element names in the first
  line of the file.

## Revision 2.1.1
- Fixed `makeStr.py` so that when making a config file output so that
  it always puts the atoms in order of number and not in order of
  species. If the atom numbers are out of order MTP can't read the
  config file.

- Fixed `makeStr.py` so that the default behavior is for it not to
  remove zeros from the concentration string. To remove zeros the
  `-remove_zero=t` flag must be used.

## Revision 2.1.0
- Changed makeStr.py so that it can optionally output on MTP config
  file instead of VASP POSCAR files. Also added a 'species_mapping'
  option to makeStr.py so that a binary enumeration can get used the
  edge of a ternary phase diagram for any edge of the ternary system
  by alternating the species_mapping.

## Revision 2.0.11
-Fixed a bug found by feifzhou in
 https://github.com/msg-byu/enumlib/issues/54 in which the code tries
 to read in the structures before `system["nD"]` has been set.

## Revision 2.0.10
-Fixed the calculation of the lattice parameter so that the lattice
 parameter for each atom will be determined by it's atomic volume with
 respect to the volume per atom of the parent cell.

## Revision 2.0.9
- Reversed the order of the tite written to the VASP style POSCARS by
  makeStr.py so that the atomic species get written first then the
  system title as given in enum.out. This is so that the POSCARS can
  be easily be read in by the quippy Atoms object.

## Revision 2.0.8
- Added the option to create subsets straight from the command line
  using `-enum -distribution all #`. This allows for the enumeration
  of subsets without having to run polya and distribution seperately
  first.

## Revision 2.0.7
- Fixed the bug reported in [issue
  #62](https://github.com/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration/issues/62).

## Revision 2.0.6
- Fixed the issue reported in [issue
  #61](https://github.com/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration/issues/61).
- Added a check to SmithNormalForm to ensure that the input matrix is
  integer.

## Revision 2.0.5
- Fixed the issue reported in [issue
  #58](https://github.com/wsmorgan/phonon-enumeration/issues/58).
- Removed a lot of unused variables.

## Revision 2.0.4
- Fixed the issue reported in issue #56 by changing M=list(HNF) to
  M=deepcopy(list(HNF)) in SmithNormalForm.
- Finished fixing the documentation.

## Revision 2.0.3
- Fixed final 4 issues found by quantifiedcode, this involved minor
  changes to phenum/symmetry.py, phenum/grouptheory.py,
  phenum/vector_utils.py, and phenum/HNFs.py.
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md to repo.

## Revision 2.0.2
- Removed deprecated code from phenum/structures.py.
- Fixed lots of minor style issues found by quantified code.
- Finished improving sphinx documentation.
- Moved phenum.symmetry._get_lattice_pointGroup to phenum.symmetry.get_lattice_pointGroup.

## Revision 2.0.1
- Started changing numpy style documentation to google style to be consitent.
- Switched to codecov and quantified code.
- Changed the nested for loops in io_utils.py and symmetry.py to itertools iterators.

## Revision 2.0.0
- Added HNFs.py to the repo which finds the unique HNFs.
- Updated the driver so that the polya mode is now stand alone.
- Updated the driver so that the distribution mode is now stand alone.
- Updated the driver so that the enumeration mode is now stand alone.
- Implemented new unit tests.
- Fixed bug in makeStr.py, the lattice vectors weren't being
  transposed after being read in.
- Fixed bugs revealed by study if hexagonal crystals.
- Fixed some integer issues for python 3.
- Finished unit testing. Now at 100% test coverage.

## Revision 1.8.3
- Removed an error message from vector_utils.py that was causing the
  code to die in cases where the code was behaving as it should.
- Fixed the data being written out to file so that the number of unit
  cells rather than the total number of atoms are written out for the
  idx value in 'enum.out'.
- Changed the largest allowed Coefficient of the
  guess_and_check_brancher subroutine. The previous limit was causing
  -1's to show up in the labeling.

## Revision 1.8.2
- Fixed the bug in tree.py that was causing the enumretation to hang. See Issue #48.

## Revision 1.8.1
- Forgot to import the new guess_and_check_brancher into the enum_sys
  subgroutine. Fixed now.

## Revision 1.8.0
- Updated the unit test outputs and test cases to reflect the changes
  in the code introduced by including the ability to eliminate
  superperiodic structures.
- Added the ability to include/exclude superperiodic structures from
  the list of unique configurations.
- Updated the fortran makefile to reflect the recent changes in enumlib.
- Changed the code so that when we are looking for a very small number
  of configurations within a very large number of possibilities the
  code will no longer do the full tree search but will instead do a
  'guess and check' method that picks a new configuration then checks
  to make sure it's not a duplicate of those present in the survivors
  list.

## Revision 1.7.1
- Refactored the drivers (enumeration.py and makeStr.py) for ease of unit testing.

## Revision 1.1.0

Refactored the code to bring it into best practices standards. All
tabs are now 4 spaces instead of 8. Other changes include:

- Moved binomial_coefficient.py and Inverse_radix_number.py into
radix_num_generator.py and renamed the file radix.py.

- Moved phonon_brancher.py to phonons.py.

- Moved arrow_group.py to grouper.py.

- Moved branch_method.py to tree.py.

- Removed the src/python folder and moved all of its contents into the
src folder.

- Added a .gitignore file.

- Removed the old phonon_out.txt output file that got added to the repo
by mistake.

If anything breaks then I made a mistake while refactoring the code.

## Revision 1.0.0

Changed the driver to make it easeir to run the code and added two
different modes for running, polya and enum. The first, polya, is used
to determine the distribution of unique arrangements for the different
cell sizes and concentrations. The second, enum, actually enumerates
the requested number of configurations for each of the desired cell
sizes and concentrations.

Added structures.py, io_utils.py, and polya.py to the src/python
folder. Also added the input folder that contains sample input and the
support folder that has the needed altered files for enumlib.

Also updated the documentation in all the code files so that they have
better formatting and are accurate to the current code.

## Revision 0.3.0

Changed from the python function to a hash function of my making so
that we could compare results easily with MatLab. Also added an
inverse hash function for the arrows. These two changes enabled a
major shift in how duplicates are found. Now instead of finding each
configuration by permuting the arrows we simply loop over the possible
hash numbers.

The output is now also saved to file for comparison to test cases.

I also fixed a bug that occured because of the change to hash
functions where the arrows weren't being permuted properly.

## Revision 0.2.1

Changed how the code determines duplicate arrows. It now does it using
a python function int(str(),n) where string is a string of the arrows
and n is the number of cardinal directions used. This number is then
compared between permuted arrows, if the permuted arrows have a
smaller numeral then the current string is not unique and won't be
saved.

The code is hard-coded for 4 cardinal directions at the moment but will
soon be switched to handle 2, 4, or 6 directions for more general use.

## Revision 0.1.1

Found two bugs in the code. The first was, if the code was handed only
a single color in the col list, i.e. 4 reds, all with or without
arrows it would fail, because, the brancher_method.py wasn't set up to
handle a single color. The error was fixed by having the code check to
see how many colors there are in the list at the start. If there is
only one then it goes to the code that adds arrows immediately instead
of starting the branch_method code. The arrow code will return the
original configuration if there are no arrows on the lattice and the
correct arrow configurations if there are.

The other error was that if two atoms of the same color were both
displaced with an arrow then the code would alter both arrows at the
same time instead of incrementing only one at a time. For example
[[1,0],[1,0]] would become [[1,1],[1,1]] and not [[1,0],[1,1]] as was
intended. The result is that the arrows always had the same
orientation. The bug was caused by pythons coping linking the two
colors/arrows together so that whatever happened to one would happen
to the other. It was fixed by making each implementation a 'deepcopy'
instead.

## Revision 0.1.0

Changed the file format for a more efficient algorithm. The code is
now run from phnon_enumeration.py instead of phonon_brancher.py. This
allows us to handle the arrows as each unique color configuration is
found, which enables us to use the stabilizers for the last color
configuration for the phonon excitations. This saves a great deal of
computation time.

Also removed the generator.py program from the repository since it has
been replaced by arrow_group.py code.

I also cleaned up a lot of the code to remove unused subroutines that
were creating a lot of clutter so the code is a lot cleaner. The
code's documentation has also been improved.

Lastly I merger radix_num_generator.py and radix_num_generator2.py so
that the code only depends on radix_num_generator.py and removed
radix_num_generator2.py from the repository.

## Initial Repository: Revision 0.0.0

First commits in initial development. Code currently works for the 2D
case when the symmetry group and the concentrations are entered into
the code as described in the README.
