## Customizations

This repo is a fork of the origin nornir Python automation framework on Github. It has following extra BICS-specific plugins:

- `GwRequest`: This is a nornir _task_ plugin that facilitates and abstracts requests to the BICS automation gateway (location: `nornir/plugins/tasks/apis/gw`)
- `filter_result`: This is a nornir _function_ plugin, that filters results based on match criteria against returned attributes (location: `nornir/plugins/functions/text/filter.py`)
- `print_status`: a _function_ plugin that prints a summary of response codes to the screen (location: `nornir/plugins/functions/text/ptable.py`)
- `print_table`: a _function_ plugin that prints the returned results in a table or csv format (location: `nornir/plugins/functions/text/ptable.py`)
- `populate_ip`: a _task_ plugin that populates a nornir-object (more specifically, the attached inventory-object) with IPv4 addresses from all IP inteface addresses (locatiom: `nornir/plugins/functions/inv/helper.py`)
- `resolve_ip`: a _function_ plugin that resolves the hostname from an IPv4 address
- `sros_bgp_route`: a _task_ plugin that is a wrapper for `GwRequest`. It looks up an IP address in the BGP-RIB without requiring the exact prefix-length (location: `nornir/plugins/tasks/aps/gw/helper.py`)
