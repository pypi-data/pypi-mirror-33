.. _anonymisation:

Overview of anonymisation
-------------------------

You set things up as follows.

- You start with one or more **source database(s)** and blank **destination
  database(s)**, plus blank **secret database(s)** that CRATE uses for
  temporary storage and storing PID-to-RID lookup information.

  - You may need to **preprocess** your source database a little, if it has
    an odd or inconvenient format.

- You create an **anonymiser config file** that points to your databases and
  governs high-level parameters relating to the anonymisation process.

- You create a **data dictionary** that describes what to do with each column
  of the source database(s). For example, some columns may be allowed through
  unchanged; some may be skipped; some may contain patient identifiers; some
  may contain free text that needs to have identifiers "scrubbed" out. You
  tell your config file about your data dictionary.

  - CRATE can draft one for you, but you will need to check it manually.

- You run the **anonymiser**, pointing it at your config file.
