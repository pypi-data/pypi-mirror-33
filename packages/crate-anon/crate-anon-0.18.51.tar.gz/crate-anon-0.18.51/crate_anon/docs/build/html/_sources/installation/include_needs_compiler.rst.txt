.. note::

    This module needs to compile itself from C/C++ source. Under Linux, this
    should just work. Under Windows, you may need to install a compiler, which
    must (to some degree) match the Python version you're using. If you don't
    have a compiler, you will get errors relating to "query_vcvarsall". For
    Python 3.4, try Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (Visual C++ 10.0) or Visual
    C++ Express 2010. Under 64-bit Windows, or if you have a later version of
    Visual Studio, see also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28251314; youâ€™ll
    need to set the ``VS100COMNTOOLS`` environment variable.
