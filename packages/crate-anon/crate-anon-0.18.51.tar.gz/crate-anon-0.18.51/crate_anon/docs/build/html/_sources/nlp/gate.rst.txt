GATE NLP applications
---------------------

GATE NLP is done via an external program [#gate]_. GATE runs in Java. CRATE
supplies an external front-end Java program (`CrateGatePipeline.java`) that
loads a GATE app, sends text to it, and returns answers.

In general, CRATE sends text to the external program (via stdin), and will
expect a result (via stdout) as a set of tab-separated value (TSV) lines
corresponding to the expected destination fields.

The `CrateGatePipeline.java` program takes arguments that describe how a
specific GATE application should be handled.

Output columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`standard NLP output columns
<standard_nlp_output_columns>`, the CRATE GATE processor produces these output
columns:

=============== =============== ===============================================
Column          SQL type        Description
=============== =============== ===============================================
_set            VARCHAR(64)     GATE output set name

_type           VARCHAR(64)     GATE annotation type name (e.g. 'Person')

_id             INT             GATE annotation ID. Not clear that this is very
                                useful.

_start          INT             Start position in the content

_end            INT             End position in the content

_content        TEXT            Full content marked as relevant. (Not the
                                entire content of the source field.)

.. _testgateapps:

Testing a GATE application manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The illustration below assumes that the main GATE application file is called
`main-bio.xgapp`, which is correct for KConnect. For others, the name is
different; see above.

- Run GATE Developer.

- Load the application:

  - :menuselection:`File --> Restore application from file`
  - find `main-bio.xgapp`, in the downloaded KConnect directory (or whichever
    the appropriate `.xgapp` file is for your application);
  - load this;
  - wait until it’s finished loading.

- Create a document:

  - :menuselection:`Right-click Language Resources --> New --> GATE Document`
  - name it (e.g. ``my_test_doc``);
  - open it;
  - paste some text in the “Text” window.

- Create a corpus

  - :menuselection:`Right-click Language Resources --> New --> GATE Corpus`
  - name it (e.g. ``my_test_corpus``);
  - open it;
  - add the document (e.g. with the icon looking like ‘G+’).

- View the application:

  - Go to the application tab (`main-bio.xgapp`), or double-click
    `main-bio.xgapp` in the left hand tree (under Applications) to open it if
    it’s not already open. For other applications: fine the appropriate
    application in the “Applications” tree and double-click it.

  - Make sure your corpus is selected in the “Corpus:” section. (There should
    already be a bunch of things in the top-right-hand box, “Selected
    processing resources”; for example, for KConnect, you’ll see
    “MP:preprocess” through to “MP:finalize”.)

- Click “Run this Application”.

- To see the results, go back to the document, and toggle on both “Annotation
  Sets” and “Annotation Lists”. If you tick "sets" in the Annotation Sets
  window (at the right; it’s colourful) you should see specific annotations in
  the Annotation List window (at the bottom).


crate_nlp_build_gate_java_interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options as of 2017-02-28:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: crate_nlp_build_gate_java_interface [-h] [--builddir BUILDDIR]
                                               [--gatedir GATEDIR] [--java JAVA]

    Compile Java classes for CRATE's interface to GATE

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help           show this help message and exit
      --builddir BUILDDIR  Output directory for compiled .class files (default: /h
                           ome/rudolf/Documents/code/crate/crate_anon/nlp_manager/

      --launch             Launch script in demonstration mode (having previously
                           compiled it)

CrateGatePipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following specimen scripts presuppose that you have set the environment
variable `GATE_DIR`, and assume specific locations for the compiled Java (e.g.
files like `CrateGatePipeline.class`); edit them as required.

Asking `CrateGatePipeline` to show its command-line options:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    THISDIR=$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )
    CRATE_NLP_JAVA_CLASS_DIR=$THISDIR/../crate_anon/nlp_manager/compiled_nlp_classes
    java \
        -classpath "${CRATE_NLP_JAVA_CLASS_DIR}":"${GATE_DIR}/bin/gate.jar":"${GATE_DIR}/lib/*" \
        -Dgate.home="${GATE_DIR}" \
        CrateGatePipeline \
        --help \
        -v -v

The resulting output (2018-04-17):

.. code-block:: none

    usage: CrateGatePipeline -g GATEAPP [-a ANN [-a ANN [...]]]
                             [--include_set SET [--include_set SET [...]]]
                             [--exclude_set SET [--exclude_set SET [...]]]

                             [-h] [-v [-v [-v]]]

    Java front end to GATE natural language processor.

    - Takes input on stdin. Produces output on stdout.
    - GATE applications produce output clustered (1) into named annotation sets
      (with a default, unnamed set). (2) Within annotation sets, we find
      annotations. (3) Each annotation is a collection of key/value pairs.
      This collection is not fixed, in that individual annotations, or keys within
      annotations, may be present sometimes and absent sometimes, depending on the
      input text.

    Required arguments:

      --gate_app GATEAPP
      -g GATEAPP
                       Specifies the GATE app (.gapp/.xgapp) file to use.

    Optional arguments:

      --include_set SET
      --exclude_set SET
                       Includes or excludes the specified GATE set, by name.
                       By default, the inclusion list is empty, and the exclusion
                       list is also empty. By specifying set names here, you add
                       to the inclusion or exclusion list. You can specify each
                       option multiple times. Then, the rules are as follows:
                       the output from a GATE set is included if (A) the inclusion
                       list is empty OR the set is on the inclusion list, AND (B)
                       the set is not on the exclusion list. Note also that there
                       is a default set with no name; refer to this one using
                       the empty string "". Set names are compared in a
                       case-sensitive manner.

      --annotation ANNOT
      -a ANNOT
                       Adds the specified annotation to the target list.
                       If you don't specify any, you'll get them all.

      --set_annotation SET ANNOT
      -sa SET ANNOT
                       Adds the specific set/annotation combination to the target
                       list. Use this option for maximum control. You cannot mix
                       --annotation and --set_annotation.

      --encoding ENCODING
      -e ENCODING
                       The character encoding of the source documents, to be used
                       for file output. If not specified, the platform default
                       encoding (currently "UTF-8") is assumed.

      --input_terminator TERMINATOR
      -it TERMINATOR
                       Specify stdin end-of-document terminator.

      --output_terminator TERMINATOR
      -ot TERMINATOR
                       Specify stdout end-of-document terminator.

      --log_tag LOGTAG
      -lt LOGTAG
                       Use an additional tag for stderr logging.
                       Helpful in multiprocess environments.

      --write_annotated_xml FILESTEM
      -wa FILESTEM
                       Write annotated XML document to FILESTEM<n>.xml, where <n>
                       is the file's sequence number (starting from 0).

      --write_gate_xml FILESTEM
      -wg FILESTEM
                       Write GateXML document to FILESTEM<n>.xml.

      --write_tsv FILESTEM
      -wt FILESTEM
                       Write TSV-format annotations to FILESTEM<n>.tsv.

      --suppress_gate_stdout
      -s
                       Suppress any stdout from GATE application.

      --show_contents_on_crash
      -show_contents_on_crash
                       If GATE crashes, report the current text to stderr.
                       (WARNING: likely to contain identifiable material.)

      --help
      -h
                       Show this help message and exit.

      --verbose
      -v
                       Verbose (use up to 3 times to be more verbose).

Asking CrateGatePipeline to run the GATE “ANNIE” demonstration:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    THISDIR=$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )
    CRATE_NLP_JAVA_CLASS_DIR=$THISDIR/../crate_anon/nlp_manager/compiled_nlp_classes
    java \
        -classpath "${CRATE_NLP_JAVA_CLASS_DIR}":"${GATE_DIR}/bin/gate.jar":"${GATE_DIR}/lib/*" \
        -Dgate.home="${GATE_DIR}" \
        CrateGatePipeline \
        -g "${GATE_DIR}/plugins/ANNIE/ANNIE_with_defaults.gapp" \
        -a Person \
        -a Location \
        -it STOP \
        -ot END_OF_NLP_OUTPUT_RECORD \
        -lt . \
        -v -v
