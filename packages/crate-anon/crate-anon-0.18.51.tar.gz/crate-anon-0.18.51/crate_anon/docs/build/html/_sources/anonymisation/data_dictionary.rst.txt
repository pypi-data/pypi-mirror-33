.. _data_dictionary:

Data dictionary (DD)
--------------------

The data dictionary is a TSV file with a single header row, and columns as
defined below. (The DD columns can be in any order as long as the header row
matches the data, and the column heading names are exactly as follows.)

Once you have edited your :ref:`anonymiser config file <anon_config_file>` to
point to your source database, you can generate a **draft data dictionary**
like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    crate_anonymise --draftdd > mydd.tsv

Now edit the data dictionary as required. Then make your config file point to
the data dictionary you want to use.

src_db
~~~~~~

This column specifies the source database, using a name that matches one from
the ``source_databases`` list in the config file.

src_table
~~~~~~~~~

This column specifies the table name in the source database.

src_field
~~~~~~~~~

This column specifies the field (column) name in the source database.

src_datatype
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This column gives the source column's SQL data type (e.g. `INT`,
`VARCHAR(50)`).

src_flags
~~~~~~~~~

This field can be blank or can contain a string made up of one or more
characters. The characters have the following meanings:

=========== ===================================================================
Character   Meaning
=========== ===================================================================
``K``       | **PK.**
            | This field is the primary key (PK) for the table it's in.

`H`         | **ADD SOURCE HASH.**
            | Add source hash of the record, for incremental updates?

            - This flag may only be set for source PK (``K``) fields (which
              cannot then be omitted in the destination, and which require the
              `index=U` setting, so that a unique index is created for this
              field).

            - If set, a field is added to the destination table, with field
              name as set by the config's source_hash_fieldname variable,
              containing a hash of the contents of the source record -- all
              fields that are not omitted, OR contain scrubbing information
              (scrub_src). The field is of type VARCHAR and its length is
              determined by the hash_method parameter (see below).

            - This table is then capable of incremental updates.

``C``       | **CONSTANT.**
            | Record contents are constant (will not change) for a given PK.

            - An alternative to ``H``. Can't be used with it.

            - The flag can be set only on src_pk fields, which can't be omitted
              in the destination, and which have the same index requirements as
              the ``H`` flag.

            - If set, no hash is added to the destination, but the destination
              contents are assumed to exist and not to have changed.

            - Be CAUTIOUS with this flag, i.e. certain that the contents will
              not change.

            - Intended for very data-intensive fields, such as BLOB fields
              containing binary documents, where hashing would be quite slow
              over many gigabytes of data.

            - Does not imply that the whole table cannot change!

``A``       | **ADDITION ONLY.**
            | Addition only. It is assumed that records can only be added, not
              deleted.

``P``       | **PRIMARY PID.**
            | Primary patient ID field. If set,

            (a) This field will be used to link records for the same patient
                across all tables. It must therefore be present, and marked in
                the data dictionary, for ALL tables that contain
                patient-identifiable information.

            (b) If the field is not omitted: the field will be hashed as the
                primary ID (database patient primary key) in the destination,
                and a transient research ID (TRID) also added.

``*``       | **DEFINES PRIMARY PIDS.**
            | This field *defines* primary PIDs. If set, this row will be used
              to search for all patient IDs, and will define them for this
              database. Only those patients will be processed (for all tables
              containing patient info). Typically, this flag is applied to a
              SINGLE field in a SINGLE table, usually the principal patient
              registration/demographics table.

``M``       | **MASTER PID.**
            | Master ID (e.g. NHS number).
            | The field will be hashed with the master PID hasher.

``!``       | **OPT OUT.**
            | This field is used to mark that the patient wishes to opt out
              entirely. It must be in a table that also has a primary patient
              ID field (because that's the ID that will be omitted). If the
              opt-out field contains a value that's defined in the
              optout_col_values setting (see below), that patient will be opted
              out entirely from the anonymised database.

``R``       | **REQUIRED SCRUBBER.**
            | If this field is a scrub_src field (see below), and this flag is
              set, then at least one non-NULL value for this field must be
              present for each patient, or no information will be processed for
              this patient. (Typical use: where you have a master patient index
              separate from the patient name table, and data might have been
              brought across partially, so there are some missing names. In
              this situation, text might go unscrubbed because the names are
              missing. Setting this flag for the name field will prevent this.)

=========== ===================================================================


scrub_src
~~~~~~~~~

One of the following values, or blank:

======================= =======================================================
Value                   Meaning
======================= =======================================================
``patient``             Contains patient-identifiable information that must be
                        removed from ``scrub_in`` fields.

``thirdparty``          Contains identifiable information about a carer,
                        family member, or other third party, which must be
                        removed from ``scrub_in`` fields.

``thirdparty_xref_pid`` This field is a patient identifier for ANOTHER patient
                        (such as a relative). The scrubber should recursively
                        include THAT patient's identifying information as
                        third-party information for THIS patient.
======================= =======================================================


scrub_method
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applicable to `scrub_src` fields, this column determines the manner in which
this field should be treated for scrubbing. It must be one of the following
values (or blank):

=========== ===================================================================
Value       Meaning
=========== ===================================================================
``words``   Treat as a set of textual words. This is the default for all
            textual fields (e.g. `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`). Typically used for
            names. Also OK for e-mail addresses.

``phrase``  Treat as a textual phrase (a sequence of words to be replaced only
            when they occur in sequence). Typically used for address
            components.

``number``  Treat as a number. This is the default for all numeric fields (e.g.
            `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`). If you have a phone number in a text field,
            use this method; it will be scrubbed regardless of
            spacing/punctuation.

``code``    Teat as an alphanumeric code. Suited to postcodes. Very like the
            numeric method, but permits non-digits.

``date``    Treat as a date. This is the default for all `DATE`/`DATETIME`
            fields.
=========== ===================================================================

decision
~~~~~~~~

One of the following two values:

=========== ===================================================================
Value       Meaning
=========== ===================================================================
``OMIT``    Omit the field from the output entirely.
``include`` Include it.
=========== ===================================================================

This is case sensitive, for safety.


inclusion_values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Either blank, or an expression that evaluates to a Python iterable (e.g. list
or tuple) with Python's `ast.literal_eval()` function (see
https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/ast.html).

- If this is not blank/None, then it serves as a **ROW INCLUSION LIST** -- the
  source row will only be processed if the field's value is one of the
  inclusion values.

- It applies to the raw value from the database (before any transformation via
  ``alter_method``).

- This is not applied to ``scrub_src`` fields (which contribute to the scrubber
  regardless).

- Note that ``[None]`` is a list with one member, `None`, whereas ``None`` is
  equivalent to leaving the field blank.

Examples:

- ``[None, 0]``
- ``[True, 1, 'yes', 'true', 'Yes', 'True']``


exclusion_values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As for ``inclusion_values``, but the row is excluded if the field's value is in
the exclusion_values list.

alter_method
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Manner in which to alter the data. Blank, or a comma-separated list of one or
more of:

=============================== ===============================================
Component                       Meaning
=============================== ===============================================
``scrub``                       **Scrub in.** Applies to text fields only. The
                                field will have its contents anonymised (using
                                information from other fields). Use this for
                                any text field that end users might store
                                free-text comments in.

``truncate_date``               **Truncate this date to the first of the
                                month.** Applicable to text or date-as-text
                                fields.

``binary_to_text=EXTFIELDNAME`` **Convert a binary field (e.g. `VARBINARY`,
                                `BLOB`) to text (e.g. `LONGTEXT`).** The binary
                                data is taken to be the representation of a
                                document. The field `EXTFIELDNAME`, which must
                                be in the same source table, must contain the
                                file extension (e.g. ``'pdf'``, ``'.pdf'``) or
                                a filename with that extension (e.g.
                                ``'/some/path/mything.pdf'``), so that the
                                anonymiser knows how to treat the binary data
                                to extract text from it.

``filename_format_to_text=FMT`` A more powerful way of specifying a filename
                                that can be created using data from this table.
                                The `FMT` parameter is an unquoted Python
                                str.format() string; see
                                https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/stdtypes.html#str.format.
                                The dictionary passed to `format()` is created
                                from all fields in the row.

                                Using an example from RiO: if your
                                ClientDocuments table contains a `ClientID`
                                column (e.g. ``999999``) and a `Path` column
                                (e.g. ``'appointment_letter.pdf'``), and you
                                know that the actual file will then be found at
                                ``C:\some\path\999999\docs\appointment_letter.pdf``,
                                then you can specify this with

                                .. code-block:: none

                                    filename_format_to_text=C:\some\path\{ClientID}\docs\{Path}

                                You probably want to apply this
                                ``alter_method`` to the `Path` column in this
                                example, though that's not mandatory.

``filename_to_text``            As for the binary-to-text option, but the field
                                contains a filename (the contents of which is
                                converted to text), rather than containing
                                binary data directly.

``skip_if_extract_fails``       If one of the text extraction methods is
                                specified, and this flag is also specified,
                                then the data row will be skipped if text
                                extrcation fails (rather than inserted with a
                                NULL value for the text). This is helpful, for
                                example, if your text-processing pipeline
                                breaks; the option prevents rows being created
                                erroneously with NULL text values, so that a
                                subsequent incremental update will fix the
                                problems once you've fixed your text extraction
                                tools.

``html_unescape``               HTML encoding is removed, e.g. convert
                                ``&amp;`` to ``&`` and ``&lt;`` to ``<``

``html_untag``                  HTML tags are removed, e.g. from
                                ``<a href="http://somewhere">see link</a>``
                                to ``see link``

=============================== ===============================================

You can specify multiple options separated by commas.

Not all are compatible (e.g. scrubbing is for text; date truncation is for
dates).

If there's more than one, text extraction from BLOBs/files is performed first.
After that, they are executed in sequence. (The position of the
skip-if-text-extraction-fails flag is immaterial.)

A typical combination might be:

.. code-block:: none

    filename_to_text,skip_if_extract_fails,scrub

or:

.. code-block:: none

    html_untag,html_unescape,scrub


dest_table
~~~~~~~~~~

Table name in the destination database.

dest_field
~~~~~~~~~~

Field (column) name in the destination database.

dest_datatype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SQL data type in the destination database.

If omitted, the source SQL data type is translated appropriately.

index
~~~~~

One of:

=========== ===================================================================
Value       Meaning
=========== ===================================================================
(blank)     No index.

``I``       Create a normal index on the destination field.

``U``       Create a unique index on the destination field.

``F``       Create a `FULLTEXT` index, for rapid searching within long text
            fields. Only applicable to one field per table.
=========== ===================================================================

indexlen
~~~~~~~~

Integer. Can be blank. If not, sets the prefix length of the index.
This is mandatory in MySQL if you apply a normal (+/- unique) index to a `TEXT`
or `BLOB` field. It is not required for `FULLTEXT` indexes.

comment
~~~~~~~

Field (column) comment, stored in the destination database.
