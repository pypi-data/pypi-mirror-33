Launch Celery
=============

When web sites want to do something slow, or spontaneously, they should not do
so within a user interaction. If the user says "build me a 1 Gb file for
download", the web site shouldn't build it and then provide it for download;
the user will think the site is unresponsive. Usually, it should reply
immediately to say "OK, working on that", do the work, and then indicate to the
user somehow that the job is done. Similarly, web sites may need to act
spontaneously (e.g. do things at midnight every day).

The general method of doing this is to have a task queue. CRATE uses Celery_
for its task queue. It creates Celery tasks when it wants to do something slow
(like checking consent modes and sending a bunch of e-mails).

In turn, Celery puts tasks into a message queue system, passing messages via
the AMQP_ protocol. By default, the message broker is RabbitMQ_. It's the job
of the broker to receive messages, keep them safe (so that they're not lost if
the system is rebooted, for example), and to make them available to software
that needs them.

When a task is run, Celery will call back into the CRATE code to get the job
done, but using a different process from the one that responded to the user's
initial HTTP request.


.. _crate_launch_celery:

crate_launch_celery
-------------------

This launches the CRATE Celery system. You need this to be running for CRATE
to work properly. (See also :ref:`Windows service <windows_service>`.)

Options as of 2016-07-21:

.. code-block:: none

    usage: crate_launch_celery [-h] [--command COMMAND] [--debug]

    Launch CRATE Celery processes. (Any leftover arguments will be passed to
    Celery.)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --command COMMAND  Celery command (default: worker)
      --debug            Ask Celery to be verbose


.. _crate_celery_status:

crate_celery_status
-------------------

This executes the command ``celery -A crate_anon.crateweb.consent status``.


.. _crate_launch_flower:

crate_launch_flower
-------------------

This command has no options. It launches the Celery Flower_ tool, which is for
monitoring Celery. It starts a local web server (by default on port 5555; see
:ref:`TCP/IP ports <tcpip_ports>`); if you browse to http://localhost:5555/ or
http://127.0.0.1:5555/, you can see what's happening on your Celery system.

--------

If Celery jobs are taken out of the queue and then crash inside CRATE, you may
wish to resubmit unprocessed work. For this, use

.. code-block:: bash

    crate_django_manage resubmit_unprocessed_tasks

See :ref:`crate_django_manage <crate_django_manage>`.
