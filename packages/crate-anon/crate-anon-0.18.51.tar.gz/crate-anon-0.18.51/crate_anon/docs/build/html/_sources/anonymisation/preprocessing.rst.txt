Preprocessing tools

These tools reshape specific databases for CRATE.

crate_preprocess_rio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RiO preprocessor creates a unique integer field named `crate_pk` in all
tables (copying the existing integer PK, creating one from an existing
non-integer primary key, or adding a new one using SQL Server’s `INT
IDENTITY(1, 1)` type. For all patient tables, it makes the patient ID (RiO
number) into an integer, called `crate_rio_number`. It then adds *indexes* and
*views*. All of these can be removed again, or updated incrementally if you add
new data.

The views ‘denormalize’ the data for convenience, since it can be pretty hard
to follow the key chain of fully normalized tables. The views conform mostly to
the names used by the Servelec RiO CRIS Extraction Program (RCEP), with added
consistency. Because user lookups are common, to save typing (and in some cases
keep the field length below the 64-character column name limit of MySQL), the
following abbreviations are used:

    *   Alters a RiO database to be suitable for CRATE.

    *   By default, this treats the source database as being a copy of a RiO
        database (slightly later than version 6.2; exact version unclear).
        Use the "--rcep" (+/- "--cpft") switch(es) to treat it as a
        Servelec RiO CRIS Extract Program (RCEP) v2 output database.


    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --url URL             SQLAlchemy database URL
      -v, --verbose         Verbose
      --print               Print SQL but do not execute it. (You can redirect the
                            printed output to create an SQL script.
      --echo                Echo SQL
      --rcep                Treat the source database as the product of Servelec's
                            RiO CRIS Extract Program v2 (instead of raw RiO)
      --drop-danger-drop    REMOVES new columns and indexes, rather than creating
                            them. (There's not very much danger; no real
                            information is lost, but it might take a while to
                            recalculate it.)
