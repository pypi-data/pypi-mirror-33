                           [-v]

    -   This program reads data from the UK Office of National Statistics Postcode
        Database (ONSPD) and inserts it into a database.

    -   You will need to download the ONSPD from
            https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/geoportal/catalog/content/filelist.page
        e.g. ONSPD_MAY_2016_csv.zip (79 Mb), and unzip it (>1.4 Gb) to a directory.
        Tell this program which directory you used.

    -   Specify your database as an SQLAlchemy connection URL: see
            http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html
        The general format is:
            dialect[+driver]://username:password@host[:port]/database[?key=value...]

    -   If you get an error like:
            UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character '\u2019' in
            position 33: ordinal not in range(256)
        then try appending "?charset=utf8" to the connection URL.

crate_fetch_wordlists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool assists in fetching common word lists, such as name lists for global
blacklisting, and words to exclude from such lists (such as English words or
medical eponyms). It also provides an exclusion filter system, to find lines in
some files that are absent from others.

      '-' for the output file to mean 'stdout', and for one input file to mean
      'stdin'. No filenames (other than '-' for input and output) may overlap.
      The --min_line_length option also applies. Duplicates are not removed.
