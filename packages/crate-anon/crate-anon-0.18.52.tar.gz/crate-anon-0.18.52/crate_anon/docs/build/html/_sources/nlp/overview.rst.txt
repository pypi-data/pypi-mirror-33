Overview of NLP
---------------

The purpose of NLP is to start with **free text** that a human wrote and end up
with **structured data** that a machine can deal with.

CRATE provides a high-level NLP management system. It churns through databases
(typically, databases that have already been de-identified by CRATE's
:ref:`anonymisation <anonymisation>` system) and sends text to one or more
**NLP processors**. It takes the results and stashes them in an NLP **output
database**.

NLP processors can be disparate. For example, CRATE has support for:

- built-in :ref:`Python NLP via regular expressions <regex_nlp>`;

- all sorts of tools that use :ref:`GATE <gate_nlp>`;

- other third-party tools like :ref:`MedEx-UIMA <medex_nlp>`.

Standard NLP output columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CRATE NLP processors use the following output columns:

=============== =============== ===============================================
Column          SQL type        Description
=============== =============== ===============================================
_pk             BIGINT          Arbitrary PK of output record

_nlpdef         VARCHAR(64)     Name of the NLP definition producing this row

_srcdb          VARCHAR(64)     Source database name (from CRATE NLP config)

_srctable       VARCHAR(64)     Source table name

_srcpkfield     VARCHAR(64)     PK field (column) name in source table

_srcpkval       BIGINT          PK of source record (or integer hash of PK if
                                the PK is a string)

_srcpkstr       VARCHAR(64)     NULL if the table has an integer PK, but the PK
                                itself if the PK was a string, to deal with
                                hash collisions.

_srcfield       VARCHAR(64)     Field (column) name of source text
=============== =============== ===============================================

The length of the VARCHAR field is set by the `MAX_SQL_FIELD_LEN` constant.
