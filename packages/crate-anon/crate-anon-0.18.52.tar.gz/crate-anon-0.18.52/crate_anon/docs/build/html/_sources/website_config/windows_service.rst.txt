CRATE Windows service
=====================

The most convenient way of running the CRATE web site is via a Windows service.
The service starts both the CRATE internal web server (via CherryPy_) and the
CRATE task queue system (via Celery_). It's the equivalent of running both
:ref:`crate_launch_cherrypy_server <crate_launch_cherrypy_server>` and
:ref:`crate_launch_celery <crate_launch_celery>` together.

To create a Windows service for CRATE, use the ``crate_windows_service``
command. You will need to run it from a command prompt with Administrator
authority.

Logs from the CRATE processes (Celery, CherryPy/Django) go to the normal disk
logs. However, output from the service itself goes to the Windows logs: see
:menuselection:`Event Viewer --> Windows Logs --> Application`.
