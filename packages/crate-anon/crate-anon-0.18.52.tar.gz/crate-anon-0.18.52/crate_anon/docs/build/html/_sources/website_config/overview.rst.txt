Configuring the web front end
=============================

You’ll need to make a new (e.g. MySQL) database for the web front end, and an
admin user with full access rights to it.

Under Windows, run the following in a suitable location.

.. code-block:: bat

    crate_print_demo_crateweb_config > my_crateweb_config.py

Make sure this file is accessible only to you, as it will contain secrets. Edit
it appropriately; see :ref:`Web config file <web_config_file>`. Make the
`CRATE_WEB_LOCAL_SETTINGS` environment variable point to it.

Now, create (or upgrade) the database structure:

.. code-block:: bat

    crate_django_manage migrate

At this point, you should be able to run ``crate_launch_cherrypy_server`` and
browse to http://127.0.0.1:8088/. You’ll also need to run

.. code-block:: bat

    crate_django_manage createsuperuser

You’ll also want to implement SSL (HTTPS) access. For Linux, instructions are
in the `instructions.txt` file as above. For Windows, the quickest is to use
the CherryPy server, launched with ``crate_launch_cherrypy_server``. For help,
run

.. code-block:: bat

    crate_launch_cherrypy_server --help

You can set an environment variable `CRATE_CHERRYPY_ARGS` and the arguments in
this string will be appended to those passed to CherryPy. For example:

.. code-block:: none

    CRATE_CHERRYPY_ARGS=--port 443 --ssl_certificate SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE --ssl_private_key SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE

If your machine is already using port 443, you may need to use another (e.g.
8443).
