Known Issues / Roadmap
======================

* In order to work correctly, this widget has to detect image type, the server should include this information in the `Content-Type` header. Right now, odoo is not doing so, but a fix has been `proposed <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/12918>`_.

===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
