Description: yarfox: Cross post from Mastodon to twitter
        ===========================================
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Get ``Python3`` and insall ``yarfox`` with ``pip``.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First, run ``yarfox setup`` and follow the instructions. This only needs to be done once.
        
        Then:
        
        * Run ``yarfox fetch`` to fetch your latest toots
        * Run ``yarfox publish`` to cross post those toots to twitter
        
        Feel free to use ``cron`` or ``systemd`` timers to automatically run these commands periodically.
        
        
        Notes
        -----
        
        All the data fetched from Mastodon and twitter will be stored as plain JSON files inside ``~/.local/share/yarfox``, so you can
        also use ``yarfox`` as some sort of backup.
