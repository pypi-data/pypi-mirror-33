New Features:

- Converted original project by [nicholaspaun](https://github.com/nicholaspaun/minervaclient/) into 
an installable pip package that will be added to the PyPi system for easier installation

- Added support for automatically installing the dependencies for this project such as `requests`, 
`beautifulsoup4`, and `urllib5`

- Added an explicit feature, `minervac search` in the command line app, for querying Minerva for 
course information on CRNs, instructors, times, dates, waitlists, and general availability

- tTe only command that works now is `minervac` which should replace the previous iteration's `mnvc` 
and `minervaclient`

- Updated the installation methods, but the majority of features only work if installing via build 
from source.  See [note](https://github.com/auryan898/minervaclient#install-via-pip)
