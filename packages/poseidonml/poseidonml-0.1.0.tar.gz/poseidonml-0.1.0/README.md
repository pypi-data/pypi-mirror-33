# Poseidon: Machine Learning - Phase II

## Overview
This repository contains the components necessary to build a docker container that can be used for training a number of ML models using network packet captures (pcaps).  The repository includes scripts necessary to do the training (e.g. "train_OneLayer.py") as well as doing the evaluation once a model has been trained (e.g. "eval_OneLayer.py")

While this repository and resulting docker container can be used completely independently, this code was written to support the Cyber Reboot Vent and Poseidon projects. See:

[Vent](https://github.com/CyberReboot/vent) plugins for evaluating
machine learning models on network data as part of the
[Poseidon](https://github.com/CyberReboot/poseidon) SDN project.

## Plugins
The current supported plugins are:
