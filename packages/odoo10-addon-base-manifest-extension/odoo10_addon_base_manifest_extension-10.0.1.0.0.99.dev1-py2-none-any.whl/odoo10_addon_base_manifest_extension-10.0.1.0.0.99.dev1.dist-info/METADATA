===============================
Module Manifest - Extra Options
===============================

This is a technical module that allows developers to make use of extra keys in
module manifests. The following keys are available currently:

* ``depends_if_installed`` - Your module will depend on modules listed here but
  only if those modules are already installed. This is useful if your module
  needs to override the behavior of a certain module (dependencies determine
  load order) but would also work without it.
* ``rdepends_if_installed`` - The modules listed here will depend on your
  module if they are already installed. This is useful if you want your module
  to be higher in the inheritance chain than the target modules and do not want
  to or cannot make changes to those modules.

Usage
=====

Add this module as a dependency and use the keys described above.

Roadmap
=======

Add support for the following additional keys:

* ``breaks`` - Used to mark some modules as being incompatible with the
  current one. This could be set up to support versioning (e.g. ``'breaks':
  ['my_module<<0.4.2']``).
* ``demo_if_installed``, ``data_if_installed``, ``qweb_if_installed`` - Dicts
  with module names as keys and lists of files as values. Used to load files
  only if some other module is installed.
* ``_if_module`` - Used on models to load them only if the appropriate module
  is installed.
