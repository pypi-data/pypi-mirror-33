Installation
============

Add this line in the eggs section of your ``buildout.cfg``::

    eggs=
        ...
        collective.jekyll

Configuration
=============

Go to the ``site control panel`` and install the product in the ``Add-ons`` panel.

Collective.jekyll provides a new panel called ``Content quality``, where the site administrator can select which symptoms are monitored on the contents.

The provided symptoms have some configuration stored in the ``Configuration registry``: look for keys with ``jekyll`` in their name.
