        =====
        
        `sigpy` is a Python package for signal reconstruction, with GPU support using cupy.
        
        `sigpy` provides commonly used signal processing functions, including convolution, FFT, NUFFT, wavelet transform, and thresholding functions. These operations are wrapped in a linear operator class (Linop), which allows easy manipulation, such as adjoint, addition, multiplication and composition. `sigpy` also implements popular iterative algorithms, such as conjugate gradient, (proximal) gradient method, primal dual hybrid gradient. All operations, except wavelet transform, can run on GPU.
        
        `sigpy` also provides a submodule `sigpy.mri` that implements common MRI iterative reconstruction methods, including SENSE reconstruction, L1-wavelet reconstruction, and total-variation reconstruction.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        This package requires python3, numpy, scipy, pywavelets, and numba. 
        
        For optional gpu support, the package requires cupy.
        
        For optional distributed programming support, the package requires mpi4py.
