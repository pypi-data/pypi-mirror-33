        A shell command to execute standard/repeatable commands in a git repo
        
        ### Installation
        
        Install plz at the system level so that it only has to be installed once.
        
        ```bash
        pip install plz-cmd
        
        # sudo may be required on your machine
        sudo pip install plz-cmd
        ```
        
        It can also be installed inside a virtualenv.  However, this means you'll have
        to install plz-cmd for each each virtualenv in use.
        
        ```bash
        virtualenv venv
        . venv/bin/activate
        
        pip install plz-cmd
        ```
        
        ### Example
        
        plz looks for a `plz.config` YAML file in the root of the git repo you're
        currently in. This file can (and should) be checked into version control.
        
        Note: this app does not currently support running plz.config files that are not inside a git repo directory.
        
        Suppose we have a `plz.config` file in the root of a git repo:
        
        ```yaml
        - id: run
          name: runserver
          cmd: ./manage.py runserver
        - id: test
          name: test code
          cmd:
          - ./manage.py test
          - yarn test
        - id: setup
          name: setup apps
          cmd:
          - pipenv install
          - pipenv run ./manage.py migrate
          - yarn install
        ```
        
        The following commands would be available:
        
        ```bash
        plz run
        plz test
        plz setup
        ```
