Description: geonames_postcode is a Python package to make geonames.org postcode
        databases accessible in Python. It provides a command line tool to
        fetch, preprocess, and store the data in a Python file per country.
        In the result very fast (in-memory) queries by postcodes and names are
        available using just a few MB per country. Some helper functions are
        part of the package to solve common tasks like getting distances and
        finding postcodes nearby.
