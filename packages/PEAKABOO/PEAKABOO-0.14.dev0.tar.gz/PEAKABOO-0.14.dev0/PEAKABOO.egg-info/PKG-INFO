Description: 
        
        PEAKABOO
        ========
        We have designed an open-source package to identify self-consistent spectrally
        and temporally evolving signatures of charge carriers after photoexcitation in
        transient absorption (TA) data. With minimal assumption, our algorithm
        recovers and visualizes the spectral and kinetics information of
        the individual population by combining methods such as multivariate
        adaptive regression spline fitting anddata clustering.
