        ### Features:
        - [x] Skeleton application is powered by Laravel Lumen

        - [ ] Reverse schema to model - repository - service and DI
        - [x] Support annotation query
        - [ ] Compile routes and generate controller with test cases

        ### Usages (Proposal)
        1. Create web service application
        ```
        $ rest create user
        ```
        2. Enter user service and write some migrations and up them with
        ```
        $ rest migrate
        ```
        3. Synchronous model - repository and service base on schema
        ```
        $ rest sync
        ```
        4. Create some endpoints in /api then controller and integration test will be ready
        ```
        $ rest api
        ```
        5. Generate Swagger documentation base
        ```
        $ rest doc
        ```
        6. Serve your application to test in browser with
        ```
        $ rest serve
        ```
        7. Check current version
        ```
        $ rest version
        ```
        8. Automatically updates
        ```
        $ rest upgrade
        ```
        9. Need more help ?
