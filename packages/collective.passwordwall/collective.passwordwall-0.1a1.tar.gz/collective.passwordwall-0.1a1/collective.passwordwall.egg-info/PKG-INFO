Description: # Passwordwall
        
        This puts your Plone site behind a login, without actually logging in a Plone user.
        
        
        ## Use case
        
        This is intended for use on public websites, so "Published" in Plone workflow
        terminology, where you want to restrict access because the site isn't meant to
        be open to the public yet.
        
        It enables people to view the site as as an anonymous user (in the Plone
        sense), so without having to log in into Plone.
        
        It is not intended for intranets, and other sites where login is required
        anyway. In that case, this product is either not necessary, or you're better
        off using iw.rejectanonymous.
        
        
        ### Plain text
        
        The site password is stored internally as plain text. Do not use your personal
        super secure password here, because we intended it to be used by several
        people.
        
        The password should be easy to look up and communicate, which is why we store
        it in plain text.
        
        If you have a different use case for this product where you want a different
        behaviour: We *do* welcome pull requests!
        
        
        ## Alternatives
        
        You might also achieve this with:
        - web server Basic Auth
        - IP restriction
        
        But if your hosting setup is such that that isn't an option,
        this package might help.
        
        
        ## How to use
        
        Go to the Plone control panel, to the "Security" tab.
        
        You will see a checkbox "Site behind password". Check it to activate the passwordwall.
        This means users will need to supply credentials before they can use the site.
        
        Users that are already logged in as Plone users are not asked for credentials.
        
        The password can be set by the "Password" field.
        This is what people have to type in the "password" box in the dialog to get access.
        
        
        ### Picking a password
        
        It's recommended to not use dictionary words as is, nor should you use other
        well known phrases as passwords. This is because their MD5 hashes (which we
        store as the cookie value) would easily reveal the password. Just mixing in a
        couple of numbers or other characters should make for a fine password.
        Try it on https://isc.sans.edu/tools/reversehash.html if you're not sure.
        
        
        ### Changing the password
        
        When you change the password, existing cookies will be invalid, because the
        password hash changed. People without Plone accounts (or who are logged out
        from Plone) will be forced to re-enter the credentials.
