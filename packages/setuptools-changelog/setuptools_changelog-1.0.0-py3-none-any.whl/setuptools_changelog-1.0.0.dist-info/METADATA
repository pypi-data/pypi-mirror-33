Setuptools Changelog
====================

This project is a setuptools extension which helps to generate change logs from
fragments. This way of changelog management is conflict free, what is extremely
helpful for PR/MR driven workflow.


Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7, 3.5+;
- setuptools (31+, but the latest release is better);
- Your project follows `Semantic Versioning`_ or uses it simplified (``X.Y``
  version) form;


Usage
-----

0. Add `setuptools-changelog` as development dependency to your project;
1. Create `changelog.d` directory in your project root directory
   (where `setup.py` is located)
2. Create there fragments files according the changes you made. Fragments files
   have the following format::

    {name}.{type}.{ext}

   Where:

   - ``name``: fragment name. If it *starts* with a number and you have
     issue tracker specified, this number will turn into issue reference
     automatically. Otherwise there could be just some mnemonic name to
     simplify navigation.

   - ``type``: fragment type. By default, the following types are available

     - Major changes:

       - ``epic``: Massive epic change that completely changes underlying
         project platform. This could be a shift to completely new base
         library, framework, etc. Epic changes are very rare and are the reason
         for major release.

       - ``breaking``: Breaking change means changes in the project
         **public API** which makes old code incompatible with them.
         Incompatibility means that things were removed or their behavior had
         changed.

     - Minor changes:

       - ``security``: This is an important security fix. Users must update
         ASAP. If security fix causes breaking change, two separate changelog
         fragments should be issued.

       - ``deprecation``: Deprecations are friendly warnings about upcoming
         breaking changes in the public API.

       - ``feature``: New features brings something to project and they must be
         available for users via public API.

     - Patch changes:

       - ``bug``: When something works in the way it's not expected or supposed
         to we do a bug fix.

       - ``improvement``: This could be speed optimizations, internals
         refactoring, making code more stable etc. Improvements are never
         changes the existed behaviour or public API.

       - ``build``: Changes, related to project build routines, packaging,
         etc.

       - ``doc``: Documentation updates, clarifications, typo fixes, etc.

       - ``test``: Work around project testing, test suite, CI, etc.

       - ``misc``: Misc changes which doesn't suites any existed category.
         For instance, they could be announcements about project life: new
         committers, endorsements, etc.

   - ``ext``: file extension. Currently, we support only `rst` one.

3. You can always preview changelog via::

      python setup.py changelog

4. Once you'll be ready for release, you can update your changelog file like::

      python setup.py changelog --update=CHANGELOG.rst

   This command will *prepend* generated changelog to your file.

5. Review your changelog file content and everything is fine commit it and
   remove fragments::

      git rm changelog.d/*
      git commit CHANGELOG.rst changelog.d/

Example configuration for ``setup.cfg`` using defaults:

.. code::

    [changelog]
    changelog_fragments_path = changelog.d
    major_changes_types =
        epic = Epic Changes
        breaking = Breaking Changes
        removal = Breaking Changes
    minor_changes_types =
        security = Security Fixes
        deprecation = Deprecations
        feature = New Features
    patch_changes_types =
        bug = Bug Fixes
        bugfix = Bug Fixes
        improvement = Improvements
        build = Build
        doc = Documentation
        test = Tests Suite
        misc = Miscellaneous


Automatic version generation
----------------------------

If your project follows `Semantic Versioning`_ strategy, you can achieve not
just changelog generation, but also automatic version management depending on
changes it has.


Integration with `towncrier`_
-----------------------------

This project was started because there are several reasons for me to not use
`towncrier`_ for changelog management. But

.. epigraph::

   Why have enemies, when you can have?

   -- King Arthur: Legend of the Sword

Instead, we can support fragments, made for towncrier with the following
config:

.. code::

    [changelog]
    changelog_fragments_path = changelog.d
    major_changes_types =
        removal = Breaking Changes
    minor_changes_types =
        feature = New Features
    patch_changes_types =
        bugfix = Bug Fixes
        doc = Documentation
        misc = Miscellaneous
    use_towncrier = true

And that's it!
