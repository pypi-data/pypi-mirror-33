are installed, this module is installed and has no special
dependencies.

The automatic workflow associated to a payment method can be chosen in
`Sales > Configuration > Sales > Payment Methods`.

Usage
=====

When a payment method is selected on a sales order, if it has an
automatic workflow, the sales order will use it.

The automatic reconcile is done by the **Automatic Workflow Job** cron.
