Description: # cfd-reader
        
        **A `python3` module to index, pre-process, and supply facial data from the Chicago Face Database (CFD).**
        
        A convenient way to load data from the Chicago Face Database, wrapped in `numpy` arrays, to feed to your neural network.
        
        ## installation
        From a terminal, run the command:
        
        `[sudo -H] pip3 install cfd-reader`
        
        ## usage
        
        In your Python (3.5+) script or interpreter session, run (suggested syntax):
        
        `import cfd_reader as cfdr`
        
        ### load face data
        
        `cfdr.load_data(`*[options]*`)`
        
        **where *options* include**:
        
        - `grayscale=[True, False]`:
            - `True`: provides 3 channel BGR output
            - `False`: provides single channel grayscale output
        - `train_proportion=x`:
            - `x`: real-valued variable between 0 and 1. `x` proportion of all data will be supplied as training data, and 1-x data will be supplied as test data
        - `resize=[False, (x,y)]`:
            - `False`: keeps images in their original resolution
            - `(x,y)`: tuple of integers to resize the image to
        
        **returns**:
        
        `numpy` array of shape `(n, x, y, c)` where `n` are the total number of images in that particular set (train/test), `(x,y)` is the 2D image shape, and `c` is the number of channels. In other words, `(x,y,c)` is the image shape.
