    Ilea is a Lea subclass, which instance represents a probability distribution obtained
    by filtering the values Vi of a given Lea instance that verify a boolean condition C,
    which is the AND of given boolean conditions Cj(Vi).
    In the context of a conditional probability table (CPT), each Ilea instance represents
    a given distribution <Vi,p(Vi|C)>, assuming that a given condition C is verified (see Blea class).
