        The most common will be: ``bw_plex watch``
        
        How it works:
        -------------
        
        Bw\_plex listens for playing events using websocket. We download the
        first 10 minutes of that episode and/or the theme music from
        YouTube/tvtunes/Plex
        
        We then create a audio print from the theme song that we match against
        the audio of the 10 minutes of the episode. (Thereâ€™s a backup method
        that uses audio silence in combination with black frames too).
        
        We then check if this episode has a recap using subtitles and audio
        where we look for clues like last season, previously on (add you own
        words in the config)
        
        Download the last part of the episode an and indentify the start and and
        of the outro
        
        Depending on your settings we will then allow playback until the theme
        start or just jump straight to intro end if we also should skip recaps.
        
        Since this is a rather slow process we also start processing the next
        episode so next time you watch the same show we instantly seek the
        client to the end of the theme.
