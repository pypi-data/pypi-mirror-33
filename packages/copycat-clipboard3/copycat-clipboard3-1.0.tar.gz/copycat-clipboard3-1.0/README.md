Command-line based clipboard tool for every command-line Ninja
```

## Description
This is a clipboard tool for command-line heavy users, especially the users who are using only console mode in daily life. Traditional clipboard stores only 1 value at the same time, copycat doesn't but store as many as you could. (if you remember their name), you could store 1 value into your system clipboard(anonymously) or store many named records.

## System Requirement.
* Supported operating systems:
    * Mac OS X 10.6 or above version
    * Linux with `xclip` installed
    * Windows (testing, we're both not familiar with Windwos, if you would add some support to Windows part, we will appreciate that. :)
* Python 3 or above version

(P.S. This script will only work on Macintosh system for now, because the concept of it is using this command to operate clipboard: `pbcopy`.)
