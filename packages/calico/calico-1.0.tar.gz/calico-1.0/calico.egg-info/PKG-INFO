        Calico is a utility for checking command-line programs in terms of their
        input and output. It checks whether a program generates the correct output
        when given some inputs. It was developed to evaluate simple programming
        assignments in an introductory programming course.

        Calico has been tested with Python 3.6+. You can install the latest version
        from PyPI::
        
           pip install calico
        
        Calico uses `pexpect`_ for interacting with the program it is checking.
        The file that specifies the inputs and outputs for the checks
        is in `YAML`_ format.
