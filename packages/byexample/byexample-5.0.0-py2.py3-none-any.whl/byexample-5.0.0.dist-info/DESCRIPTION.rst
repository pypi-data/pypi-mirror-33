``byexample``
=============

``byexample`` is a literate programming engine where you mix ordinary
text and snippets of code in the same file and then you execute them as
regression tests.

It is primary intended for writing good and live tutorials and
documentation showing how a piece of software works or it can be used
*by example*.

Currently we support:

-  Python (compatible with ``doctest``)
-  Ruby
-  Shell (``sh`` and ``bash``)
-  GDB (the `GNU
   Debugger <https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/>`__)
-  C++ (using `cling <https://github.com/root-project/cling>`__ -
   *experimental*)

The documentation of each one can be found in ``docs/languages/``.

More languages will be supported in the future. Stay tuned.

Contribute
----------

Go ahead, fork this project and start to hack it. Run ``make test`` to
ensure that everything is working as expected and then propose your Pull
Request!

There are some interesting areas where you can contribute like:

-  add support to new languages (Javascript, Julia, just listen to you
   heart)
-  misspelling? I'm not an English native so any grammatical correction
   is welcome
-  add more examples. How do you use ``byexample``? Give us your
   feedback!
-  is ``byexample`` producing a hard-to-debug diff or you found a bug?
   Create an issue in github

Usage
-----

Install and run it against any source file(s), like this README. All the
snippets will be collected, executed and checked.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install --user byexample                # install it # byexample: +skip
    $ byexample -l python,ruby,shell README.rst   # run it     # byexample: +skip
    ................
    File README.rst, 20/20 test ran in <...> seconds
    [PASS] Pass: 17 Fail: 0 Skip: 3

You can select which languages to run, over which files, how to display
the differences and much more.

The ``doc/usage.rst`` document goes through almost all the flags that
the ``byexample`` program has.

Snippets of code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any snippet of code that it is detected by ``byexample`` will be
executed and its output compared with the text below.

This is a quite useful way to test and document by example.

Any code that is written inside of a Markdown fenced code block will be
parsed and executed depending of the language selected.

Here is an example in Python

.. code:: python

    1 + 2

    out:
    3

The expression ``1 + 2`` is executed and the output compared with ``3``
to see if the test passes or not.

For some languages, we support the interpreter-session like syntax.

For Python we use ``>>>`` and ``...`` as prompts to find this sessions

.. code:: python

    >>> def add(a, b):
    ...   return a + b

.. code:: python

    add(1, 2)

    out:
    3

There is not restriction in which snippets you can add. You can even mix
snippets of different languages in the same file!

Here is an example in Ruby

.. code:: ruby

    def add(a, b)
      a + b
    end;

    add(2, 6)

    out:
    => 8

The documentation of each language can be found in ``docs/languages/``.

The 'match anything' wildcard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, if the expected text has the ``<...>`` marker, that will
match for any string.

Very useful to match long unwanted or uninteresting strings.

.. code:: python

    print(list(range(20)))

    out:
    [0, 1, <...>, 18, 19]

Capture
~~~~~~~

The ``<name>`` marker can be used to capture any string (like ``<...>``)
but also it assigns a name to the capture.

Currently the strings captured cannot be used in any place but there are
plans to use it to enhance the tests.

Crazy ideas (not implemented yet): - If a tag ``<foo>`` is repeated,
test that all of the capture the same string, otherwise fail the test. -
Enable a raw copy & paste: capture a string in one example and paste it
in other.

Option flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~

``byexample`` supports a set of flags or options that can change some
parameters of the execution of the example.

Some flags are generic, others are interpreter-specific.

Normalize whitespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Replace any sequence of whitespace by a single one. This makes the test
more robust against small differences (trailing spaces, space/tab
mismatch)

.. code:: python

    print(list(range(20)))              # byexample: +norm-ws

    out:
    [0,   1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,
    10,  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

Skip and Pass
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``skip`` will skip the example completely while ``pass`` will execute it
normally but it will not check the output.

.. code:: python

    a = 1
    a = 2       # this assignment will not be executed # byexample: +skip
    a

    out:
    1

.. code:: python

    def f():
        print("Choosing a random number...")
        return 42

    a = f()     # execute the code but ignore the output # byexample: +pass
    a

    out:
    42

Timeout
^^^^^^^

The execution of each example has a timeout which can be changed by a
flag

.. code:: python

    import time
    time.sleep(2.5) # simulates a slow operation # byexample: +timeout=3

Extend ``byexample``
--------------------

It is possible to extend ``byexample`` adding new ways to find examples
in a document and/or to parse and run/interpret a new language or adding
hooks to be called regardless of the language/interpreter.

The ``doc/how_to_extend.rst`` is a quick tutorial that shows exactly
that.
