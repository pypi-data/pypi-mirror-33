# EthPM Package Specification

## Overview

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethpm/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/ethpm/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethpm/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository comprises the formal specification and documentation source
for the **EthPM package manifest** data format.

This data format is designed to be produced/consumed by Ethereum
development tools. As such, this repository is intended for tool developers
wishing to integrate with EthPM.

Package manifests are JSON-encoded, tightly-packed, with objectsâ€™ keys sorted
in lexicographic order. Package manifests may live on disk, but are intended
to be produced programmatically and uploaded directly to a content-addressable
storage network (e.g. [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)). A package manifest describes
a single package, including package name, version, dependencies, and references
to distributed source files.

documented examples of different kinds of packages with varying levels of
complexity. Source for use case examples can be found in the

## Specification

The EthPM package manifest format is formally specified as a
[JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org).

Please see [**Package Specification**](http://ethpm.github.io/ethpm-spec/package-spec.html)
for a natural-language description of this schema, or see
[package.spec.json](https://github.com/ethpm/ethpm-spec/blob/master/spec/package.spec.json)
for the machine-readable version.
