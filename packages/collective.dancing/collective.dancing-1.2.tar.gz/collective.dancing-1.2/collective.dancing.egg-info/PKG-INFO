        What is it?
        ===========
        
        *Singing & Dancing* is the next generation newsletter Product for
        Plone.  It's an out of the box solution that works without
        modification for most of your use cases.  And should you find
        something that Singing & Dancing can't do, it's built to be easily
        extended via plug-ins using the Zope 3 Component Architecture.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        Modern and extensible
          Singing & Dancing builds on the latest and greatest efforts in the
          Zope and Plone world.  It makes heavy use of the excellent
          ``z3c.form`` library and the Zope 3 Component Architecture.  This
          allows you to easily plug in and extend Singing & Dancing to fit
          your needs.
        
        Well tested
          An extensive suite of automated tests make Singing & Dancing
          exceptionally stable and reliable.  We currently have 200+ tests.
          Singing & Dancing is not gonna leave you in the lurch!
        
        Fully managable through the Plone interface
          Singing & Dancing is fully usable out of the box.  An extensive
          set of forms reachable through the configuration panel let you as
          the user configure many details of your newsletters, like *when*
          they're sent (periodically or manually), *what* is sent (through the
          use of the *Smart Folder* interface, or manually), and to whom.
        
        Subscriptions
          Singing & Dancing uses *confirmed subscription*, i.e. subscribers
          receive an e-mail to confirm their subscription.  Users can
          subscribe via a standard subscription form that lists all available
          newsletters in the site, or through individual subscription forms,
          e.g. in portlets.
        
        Personalisation
          Singing & Dancing allows a channel to define optional collectors
          or *sections* which a user can optional subscribe to. Scheduled
          daily or weekly newsletters can then include additional content
          personalised to those segments of the channel.
        
        External subscriber database
          Optionally instead of using the builtin subscriber database and
          subscription forms you can use another product such as Plomino of
          PloneFormGen. Configure a path to a script to list the subscribers
          is is all that is needed to intergrate S&D with your external
          subscriber database.
        
        Automatic sending
          Any Plone content item can be sent at a scheduled time using the
          "Send as newsletter" feature. These can be sent to the whole
          subscriber list or to a specific section.
          Content rules can be configured to send an item as a newsletter
          immediately under certain conditions including if it matches a
          of Singing & Dancing's *collection* based *collector*.

        User Manual
        ===========
        
        The Singing & Dancing user manual is available here:
        http://www.webtide.co.za/how-to/singing-dancing-user-manual
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of Singing & Dancing uses buildout_.  If you don't know
        what buildout is or `how to create a buildout`_, `follow this
        tutorial`_ first.
        
        These instructions assume that you already have a Plone buildout that's built
        and ready to run.
        
        Singing & Dancing is available as `Python eggs on PyPI`_.
        
        To install Singing & Dancing, add it to your buildout by following
        these steps:
        
        * Plone 3.x
        
          1) Edit your ``buildout.cfg`` file and look for the ``[buildout]``
             section.  Add an ``extends =`` option in that section like the
             following::
        
                 [buildout]
                 extends = https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dancing/buildout-extends/0.9.0.cfg
                 parts =
                     zope2
                     ...
        
                 Should you already have an ``extends =`` line, add the new line at
                 the end of the other extends files.  For Plone 3.2.2, your
                 ``[buildout]`` section might start like this::
        
                 [buildout]
                 extends =
                     http://dist.plone.org/release/3.2.2/versions.cfg
                     https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dancing/buildout-extends/0.9.0.cfg
                 parts =
                     zope2
                     ...
        
          2) Next, you'll need to add ``collective.dancing`` to the ``eggs`` and
             ``zcml`` options in your ``[instance]`` section.  Which should then look
             like this::
        
                 [instance]
                 ...
                 eggs =
                     ${buildout:eggs}
                     ...
                     collective.dancing
                 zcml =
                     ...
                     collective.dancing
        
             Note: When you are using Plone > 3.3 you can skipt the zcml part, because
             ``z3c.autoinclude`` is shipped with Plone 3.3.x by default.
        
        
          3) Remove all ``additional-fake-eggs`` and ``skip-fake-eggs`` options
             from your ``[zope2]`` section, if any.  (This is so you don't
             overrride the ones defined in the S&D extends file that we added in
             step 1.)
        
        * Plone 4.x
        
          1) On Plone 4 you don't need to extend your buildout configuration using
             `extends=...``. You'll need to add ``collective.dancing`` to the ``eggs``
             in your ``[instance]`` section.  Which should then look like this::
        
                 [instance]
                 ...
                 eggs =
                     ${buildout:eggs}
                     ...
                     collective.dancing
        
          2) Please use version pins out of ``versions.cfg`` file which is included in
             package if you have package conflicts or strange errors.
        
        Once you're done editing your buildout configuration, don't forget to
        run your buildout again before you start up Zope::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout -v
        
        That's it!  You can now start up your Zope instance, and then install
        Singing & Dancing in your Plone site by visiting the *Add-on Products*
        site control panel.
        
        Troubleshooting
        ---------------
        
        Should the above instructions not work for you, `contact us`_.
        
        **NOTE**: If you're upgrading your buildout from an older version
        where you included version dependencies of S&D by hand, remove the
        ``develop-eggs`` directory inside your buildout and re-run buildout.
        
        Here's a list of the most common stumbling blocks:
        
           - `ValueError: too many values to unpack <https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/253377>`_
        
           - `Products/Five/i18n.zcml uses namespace package in configure package directive <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/228254>`_
        
           - Should you see ``ImportError: Module
             zope.app.component.metaconfigure has no global defaultLayer``
             when starting up, make sure you have
             ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` >= 2.2.  You may use buildout's
             ``versions`` feature to tell it which version to use.
        
           - Since version 0.7.0 of collective.singing we don't support older
             versions of ``z3c.form`` by default. Radio button and checkbox widget
             hidden templates are already included in more recent ``z3c.form``
             versions. ( > 2.3.3 as described here
             http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form#id14)
        
             If you want to use an old version (for example the popular 1.9.0 which was
             pinned in older buildout-extends files) you have to manually include a
             zcml file located in ``collective.singing.browser.widgets.zcml`` which
             registers the missing templates for these widgets::
        
                <include package="collective.singing.browser" file="widgets.zcml" />
        
             This fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/620608.
        
        It's installed.  What's next?
        -----------------------------
        
        You'll now have an entry in the control panel to *Singing & Dancing*.
        This will lead you to to the advanced configuration panel of S&D.
        
        Note that there's already a default newsletter set up for your
        convenience.  You can create a *Mailing-list subscribe portlet* to enable
        your users to subscribe to this channel, or you can point them to
        http://yoursite/portal_newsletters/channels/default-channel/subscribe.html
        
        To send out a newsletter, go to any portal object, like the Plone
        front page, and click *Actions -> Send as newsletter*.
        
        The advanced configuration panel of S&D gives you many more ways to
        send newsletters, like periodically and from automatically collected
        content.
        
        Processing the message queue
        ----------------------------
        
        One important thing to note is that S&D usually queues messages in its
        own message queue before sending them out.  You might have noticed
        that when you send out a newsletter, S&D tells you that it queued the
        messages.
        
        In a production setup, you would normally process the message queue
        periodically using the built-in Zope ClockServer_.  While you're
        testing, you can visit the *Statistics* screen in the S&D advanced
        configuration panel and manually clear the queues.  If your mail
        configuration in Plone is set up correctly, you should be sending mail
        out now.
        
        To set up ClockServer to trigger the processing automatically for you,
        add this stanza to the Zope 2 ``[instance]`` section of your buildout
        configuration and rerun ``bin/buildout -v``::
        
          zope-conf-additional =
              <clock-server>
                # plonesite is your plone path
                method /plonesite/@@dancing.utils/tick_and_dispatch
                period 300
                user admin
                password admin
                # You need your *real* host here
                host www.mysite.com
              </clock-server>
        
        Or, if your site is behind Apache using a Virtual Host,
        the zope.conf clock server configuration would be ::
        
          zope-conf-additional =
              <clock-server>
                # plonesite is your plone path
                # www.mysite.com your site url
                method /VirtualHostBase/http/www.mysite.com:80/plonesite/VirtualHostRoot/@@dancing.utils/tick_and_dispatch
                period 300
                user admin
                password admin
              </clock-server>
        
        This will process the message queue every five minutes.  It assumes
        that your Plone site's ID is ``portal``, that your username and
        password are ``admin``, and that your site is called
        ``www.mysite.com``.
        
        **Note**: You must not set up this ClockServer on more than one
        instance.  The processing makes sure it's not invoked twice at the
        same time by using file locking.  This file locking won't work if you
        configure the clock server on two different servers.
        
        Configuring zope.sendmail to send out messages
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        Singing & Dancing uses `zope.sendmail`_ to send out its mail.  S&D
        comes with a default configuration for ``zope.sendmail`` in its
        ``collective/dancing/mail.zcml`` file.  This configuration will read
        SMTP parameters from your Plone site.
        
        Be warned however, that this default configuration is not suitable for
        high-volume newsletters.  The aforementioned configuration file
        contains an example configuration using ``mail:queuedDelivery`` that
        works much more reliably when dealing with a large number of mails.
        
        Upgrade
        =======
        
        If you're upgrading your version of Singing & Dancing, it might be
        that you need to run an upgrade of the database.  In the
        ``portal_setup`` tool in the ZMI, visit the *Upgrades* tab and run any
        available new upgrades for the ``collective.dancing:default`` profile.
        
        
        Contact us
        ==========
        
        If you have a question, or comment, get in touch with us!  Feel free to
        extend S&D and send us a pull-request on github. Since all collective and
        plone packages moved to github we `prefer reporting issues on github`_ too.
        
        If you have an older installation you may also want to have a look to our
        `mailing list`_ or `old issue tracker on launchpad`_.
        
        We also have an IRC channel called ``#singing-dancing`` on Freenode_.
        
        
        Donate
        ======
        
        Developing software as Open Source can be a thankless task sometimes.
        If you're a happy user of Singing & Dancing, and you'd like to show your
        appreciation, you might want to `donate via PayPal`_.
        
        There's other ways to contribute to the project if you're not a
        developer; one is to post a message to the `mailing list`_ describing
        any successes or problems that you have with the software.  That's the
        only way we can know if S&D is working correctly for you.
        
        Another is to add a line to the `sites using S&D`_. Please fork S&D and update
        ``SITES_USING_SINGING_AND_DANCING.rst`` in docs directory. After finishing you
        can send us a pull request, and we'll merge it.
        
        
        Developers
        ==========
        
        Singing & Dancing is built from scratch to be extensible.  All
        components described in the `interfaces.py`_ file in
        ``collective.singing`` are pluggable.
        
        Developer documentation exists in the form of doctests and Zope 3
        interfaces in the source tree.  To check out the development buildout,
        type this into your terminal::
        
          git clone https://github.com/collective/collective.dancing singing-dancing-dev
        
        When the checkout is complete, you can find the doctests in ``*.txt``
        files in the ``src/collective.singing/collective/singing/`` and
        ``collective/dancing/`` directories.  There's also a documentation area for
        use cases and manuals in ``docs/``.
        
        Get in touch with us if you need help or have comments.  See the
        `Contact us`_ section.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2 (2018-06-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Fix tests by (temporarily) pinning Plone 4.3.x to 4.3.11
          and dropping support for Python2.6 (Plone 4.0 and 4.1)
        
        - PreviewSubscription prints `{variablename}` instead of `None` for fields
          without default value. This makes it easier for users to check if substitution
          works and variables are placed correctly when previewing newsletters.
        
        - Fix variable replacement in the "subscriptions removed successfully" message for
          German translation [fRiSi]
        
        
        1.1 (2017-03-03)
        ----------------
        
        - Include metadata when exporting subscriptions for a channel:
        
          * creation_date: The creation date of this subscription
        
          * pending:
        
            allows to identify subscriptions that have not been validated (pending=True)
            (otherwhise ex- and importing would add users that did not confirm their subscription)
        
            True
              subscription has not been validated (will not receive newsletters)
        
            False
              subscription has been validate
        
            imported
              subscription has been imported or added by an admin
        
          * cue:
        
            The date this subscription has received the last newsletter
        
          * secret:
        
            Used to authenticate when (un-)subscribing and editing personal preferences
        
            * portal_newsletters/channels/my-channel/unsubscribe.html?secret=8a27d9c4fc2f8f0f031d654dc3172844
        
            * portal_newsletters/my-subscriptions.html?secret=8a27d9c4fc2f8f0f031d654dc3172844
        
            Future versions might support to import the secret so unsubscribe links work after re-importing a subscription.
        
        - Do not show subscription form on channel/subscribe.html if
          `channel.subscribeable == False` [fRiSi]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2015-11-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix readme file.
          [ivanteoh]
        
        1.0.1 (2015-11-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fix html generation in `preview.pt`. Now it generates only 1 <body> tag.
          This was a problem with plone.protect's transform.
          [cekk]
        
        - Allow to confirm a subscription for multiple channels (fixes #8)
          [fRiSi]
        
        - Disable diazo for `@@preview-newsletter.html`
          [fRiSi]
        
        - Disable CSRF protection on `tick_and_dispatch` request (fixes #24)
          [ivanteoh]
        
        
        1.0 (2015-05-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Don't try to patch ATTopic if ``plone.app.collection`` is available.
          [saily]
        
        - Made all tests pass.
          [saily]
        
        - Add some helper functions to composer which allows ``plone.z3cform``
          to render wysiwyg-widget with TinyMCE on channel edit form which
          passes a composer as context.
          [saily]
        
        - Update buildout(s) and add travis tests for plone 4.0, 4.1, ... 4.3.
          [saily]
        
        - Align package structure to new plone conventions.
          [saily]
        
        - Fix call of ``getSiteManager`` because imports changed from
          ``import zope.component`` to ``from zope import component``.
        
        - plone4.3 compat [kiorky]
        
        - "single subscribe form" now clears secret after
          unsubscribing from all channels. The email address
          is preserved and the user is able to re-subscribe or
          subscribe with another address.
          [tmog]
        
        - Add "Clear pending jobs" button on
          statistics page.
          [tmog]
        
        - Updated danish translations.
          [tmog]
        
        - Add better status message when unsubscribing from all channels
          on "single subscribe form".
          [tmog]
        
        - Key-fields, such as "E-mail address" is now disabled on "single
          form subscription page" when viewing an existing subscription.
          This was misleading anyway, since they could not really be changed.
          [tmog]
        
        - Fix #924124: When using "single form subscription page"
          User email no longer leaks into the default text of "E-mail address"
          in subscribe.html for all sessions after user manages subscription.
          [tmog]
        
        - Fix test breakage with newer versions of zope.testbrowser
          Tested on zope.testbrowser 3.10-3.11.1
          zope.testbrowser-3.11.1 will be pinned in the test buildout
          for now.
          [tmog]
        
        - Fix newsletter queue handling. Now the key to get a newsletter is the UID and not the path.
          In this way, newsletters can be renamed/moved also when they are already in the queue, and
          if they will be erased, the dispatch doesn't breaks.
          [cekk]
        
        - Added two new events, raised when an user confirm or remove his subscription.
          [cekk]
        
        - Fix Italian translations [cekk]
        
        - Added content rules to allow automated sending of content as a newsletter.
          [djay]
        
        - Configure content rule to send as newsletter or send as link and summary only.
          [djay]
        
        - "Send as Newsletter" can now be sent to an optionally subscribed section rather
          than the whole channel.
          [arterrey]
        
        - Import / export CSV file includes section values, and backward compatible with original format.
          [ivanteoh]
        
        - External subscriber database and sign up form support.
          [ivanteoh]
        
        0.9.10 (2012-02-25)
        -------------------
        
        - Fix #363127: persistent utilities will no longer destroy site after
          an uninstall of S&D.
          [nouri]
        
        - remove deprecation warning on plone4.1
          [toutpt]
        
        0.9.9 (2011-07-22)
        ------------------
        
        - Work around incompatibility with plone.app.z3cform's base template, by
          changing the request in our own `switch_on` function and removing the more
          specialized `IPloneFormLayer`, thus falling back on the layer from
          `plone.z3cform` and its base template.
          Closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/697348.
          [hannosch]
        
        0.9.8 (2011-07-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Replace several untranslatable strings.
          [pfurman]
        
        - Fixed compatibility with Plone 4.1 by (conditionally) loading the
          permissions.zcml from CMFCore.  (Still works on Plone 3.3 and 4.0
          too.)
          [maurits]
        
        - Link to new manual.
          [nouri]
        
        0.9.7 (2011-02-23)
        ------------------
        
        - Support acquisition-wrapped channel; the possible wrapping of the
          channel object is particularly important with subscriptions since
          the ``five.intid`` utility is used to track them and has delicate
          code to avoid acquisition "loops".
          [malthe]
        
        - Fixed issue that allowed an anonymous user to confirm a random
          subscriber from a channel for which the standard confirm view is
          exposed.
          [malthe]
        
        0.9.6 (2011-02-10)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed critical issue that allowed an anonymous user to unsubscribe a
          random subscriber from a channel for which the standard unsubscribe
          view is exposed.
          [malthe]
        
        - Fixed unclosed input tag for including the hidden secret.
          [maurits]
        
        0.9.5 (2010-12-26)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated the patched `queryCatalog` method of the collection class with
          changes from the baseline.
          [hannosch]
        
        0.9.4 (2010-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed release.
        
        0.9.3 (2010-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        - Added configuration setting for ``keep_sent_messages`` (new in
          ``collective.singing`` 0.7.1).
          [malthe]
        
        - Fixed CSV Download view for not to break on composers that include list,
          boolean and datetime fields.
          [piv]
        
        - Documentation updates.  [saily]
        
        - Added italian translation, thanks to Augusto Sosa.  [saily]

        - Fixed the stub mailer (encoding issue). [malthe]
        
        0.9.1 (2010-11-04)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the stub mailer (how it ever could work is unclear). [malthe]
        
        - Update test to pass on Plone4
          [toutpt] [pbauer]
        
        - Refactoring send/preview form because formtabbing did not work.
          [saily]

          types any more (RichDocument is a folderish content type).
          [saily]
        
        0.9.0 (2010-08-01)
        ------------------
        
        - The send form is now split into two subforms, one for send, and one for
          preview. **NOTE!** This introduces incompatible changes if you are having
          custom forms (although the changes necessary are simple).
          [regebro]
        
        - The "Send as newsletter" action is now no longer shown on folders by
          default.
          [regebro]
        
        - A new 'mass delete from csv' feature has been added to the channel
          administration page. [kiorky]
        
        - French translations have been updatedĂÂ [kiorky]
        
        - "Channels" have been renamed "Mailing-lists" in the userinterface. [regebro]

          [maurits]

        - When compactifying the sent html with stoneagehtml catch an error that
          can occur with some css code, that stoneagehtml tries to clean up
          using cssutils.

          [maurits]
        
        - Changed all occurences of site-title to site_title (in help strings
          and translations).

          [maurits]
        
        - We now avoid including all zcml from five.intid (in the same way as e.g.
          plone.app.intid) This means we avoid registering the IPersistent handlers,
          which (among other issues) can cause problems for packages that put persistent
          items in temporary storage. Instead we explicitly register handlers for
          ISubscription. The issue is discussed here:
          http://www.mail-archive.com/zodb-dev@zope.org/msg04398.html
          And at length, as pertaining to the getpaid package, here:

          [tmog]
        
        - Reverted changeset 113529 since it broke subscriber searching (and tests).
          The revert has likely reintroduced a problem with deleting subscriptions,
          but I've been unable to reproduce this.
          [tmog]
        
        - When importing email addresses, convert all addresses to lowercase
          instead of rejecting them.
          [maurits]
        
        - Update french translation
          [toutpt]
        
        Version 0.8.16 - 2010-04-07
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fixed translations that were causing compile errors on Zope startup,
          resulting in old translations showing up for a language (taken from
          the outdated .mo file), or no translations at all.
          [maurits]
        
        - Updated Dutch translations.
          [maurits]
        
        - Fixed a bug that made it impossible to delete some subscriptions.
          [regebro]
        
        Version 0.8.15 - 2010-02-01
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added a development buildout and automated test runner setup to the package.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Fixed ConfigurationError: ('Missing parameter:', 'description') on Plone 3
          with the last upgrade steps.
          [toutpt]
        
        Version 0.8.14 - 2010-01-28
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added missing upgrade steps for all recent versions. This makes the package
          comply with the upgrade logic of the Plone add-ons control panel.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Follow best practice and decouple the profile metadata from the software
          version in setup.py.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added a z3c.autoinclude entry point to mark this as a Plone add-on.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Added our own overrides.zcml to load the one from plone.z3cform. You cannot
          load overrides in the configure stage.
          [hannosch]
        
        - Add log on ATTopic Patch.

        - Fix i18n pot file by escape quotes.
          [toutpt]
        
        - Extended the HTML composer so that you can select which composer template
          to use. You register new composer templates by instantiating a template
          somewhere in your code::
        
            >>> mytemplate = ViewPageTemplateFile('browser/composer-html.pt')
        
          and registering that in ZCML::
        
            <utility component=".module.mytemplate"
                   name="My Custom Template"
                   provides="collective.dancing.interfaces.IHTMLComposerTemplate" />
        
          [regebro]
        
        Version 0.8.13 - 2009-10-19
        ---------------------------
        
        - The attribute 'subscribeable' now defaults to False on newly created
          channels. This means newly created channels will not show up on my-subscriptions
          before they are made subscribeable from the channels configuration page.
          [tmog]
        
        - Disabled stoneagehtml style attributes blacklist since it stripped
          out font-familiy from the styles added to a channel which confused
          several users. This fixes http://tinyurl.com/ygmhv7a
          Unfortunately its not possible to specify a custom
          black list like stoneagehtml.compactify(html, filter_tags=['position'...])
          since the stoneagehtml dosen't support that yet - http://tinyurl.com/ykwca4p.
          [pelle]
        
        - Fixed bug that caused the "Include collector items" option to
          be ignored (i.e. always on) in "Send as newsletter" previews.
          Also, there is now a default cue for the dummy preview subscriber.
          The cue is always "one week ago".
          [tmog]
        
        Version 0.8.12 - 2009-09-15
        ---------------------------
        
        - Changed the email address validation. The old one allowed a few bad
          addresses to slip through - addresses with trailing dots for instance.
          The new validation is generally stricter. Note that 'simple' local addresses
          like 'admin@localhost' are no longer allowed. For special use-cases where you
          need this, you must change the validation RegExp. However, for most usecases, I
          believe this is a big improvement.
          [tmog]
        
        Version 0.8.11 - 2009-09-03
        ---------------------------
        
        - Added alternative "My subscriptions" page. It's based on a single form
          with subforms, instead of multiple forms like the old one. It's main
          feature is that it displays the ISubscriptionKey (the email address ;-))
          and "subscribe" button only once. It has a checkbox for subscribing to
          each channel.
          To try the new version, select it from the new "Global settings" controlpanel.
          [tmog]
        
        - Translated new messageids for german language and updated some old ones.
          [saily]
        
        Version 0.8.10 - 2009-06-11
        ---------------------------
        
        - Fix bug where collector sort criteria other than 'created' and
          'effective' would result in an error. [nouri]
        
        - Fixed and added test for newsletter preview form.  The preview in
          the channel page would fail before with ``TypeError: eval() arg 1
          must be a string or code object``. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.8.9 - 2009-03-11
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix the bug that Doug found where items from collectors would be
          rendered fully. [nouri]
        
        - Update installation instructions to account for Plone 3.2.x
          buildouts, which are somewhat different. [nouri]
        
        - Added optional keyword argument ``override_vars`` to
          Composer.render.  ``override_vars`` are now a override individual
          ``composer_vars`` from e.g. the ``send-newsletter.html`` form.
        
          I've included an example of this in the section "Customizing the
          send as newsletter form" in browser.txt (and the new
          ``send-newsletter-custom-subject.html`` view).  This is a pretty
          pervasive change since it needs to work with asynchronous sending,
          email-previewing, browser-previewing, and with scheduled delivery.
        
          Included is an upgrade step for migrating ``TimedScheduler.items``
          to the new format.  Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how
          to run upgrades.  [tmog]
        
        Version 0.8.8 - 2009-02-01
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix a dependency issue with collective.singing. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.8.7 - 2009-02-01
        --------------------------
        
        - We now have much easier installation instructions. [nouri]
        
        - Fix #313044: Don't mess up ``javascript:`` links when making
          absolute links out of relative ones. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.8.6 - 2009-01-20
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix #318725: Don't mess up ``mailto:`` links when making absolute
          links out of relative ones.  Thanks to Scribbles. [nouri]
        
        - Exclude all markup with class ``newsletterExclude`` when sending out
          mail.  This allows for a lo-fi way of marking parts of your template
          for exclusion if you can't be bothered to write your own
          ``IFormatItem``. [nouri]
        
        - Added sort_criteria dict to the collector module. It allows to specify
          different query based on the current cue for different sort criteria.
          [naro]
        
        Version 0.8.5 - 2009-01-05
        --------------------------
        
        - Extended the CVS input of subscribers to allow arbitrary CVS fields
          to be stored as part of the subscriptions, and then included in the
          composer output using the ``${composervariableFIELDNAME1}``
          syntax. [russf]
        
        Version 0.8.4 - 2009-01-02
        --------------------------
        
        - Added some sensible defaults to
          ``collective.dancing.composer.plone_html_strip`` so that key html is
          filtered out. [pigeonflight]
        
        - Add experimental support for zexp. [nouri]
        
        - Added upgradestep to migrate existing MessageQueues to
          collective.singing.queue.CompositeQueue.
          This fixes slow iteration over large queues and
          extremely slow rendering of the staticstics page.
          [tmog]
        
        Version 0.8.3 - 2008-12-03
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix issue with unicodeerrors on statistics page because of bad Job-messages.
          Described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/299950
          [tmog]
        
        - Part of Czech translation.
          [naro]
        
        - Improved block structure and added classes and ids. Replaced paras with divs.
          These changes will impact existing CSS.  [russf]
        
        - Use of ``Template().substitute`` will be fatal on any un-escaped where $ will
          occur - like on all recent news items :( safe_substitute behaves properly in
          these cirumstances.  [russf]
        
        - Some refactoring in order to allow for more customized subscription forms.
          [nouri]
        
        - Added french translation.
        
        - Made new job-view ``browser/jobs.pt`` translateable, rebuilt pot file and
          updated german translation.  [saily]
        
        Version 0.8.2 - 2008-11-17
        --------------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug in ``HTMLComposer`` where unsubscribe_url could not be substituted
          by template engine because of double dollars in variable name.  [saily]
        
        Version 0.8.1 - 2008-11-14
        --------------------------
        
        - Small refactoring of tests to allow for reuse of test infrastructure
          in third party tests. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.8.0 - 2008-11-12
        --------------------------
        
        - Added bouncing support: The new utility view
          ``@@dancing.utils/handle_bounce`` takes a list of addresses and
          marks subscriptions as pending when it receives more than two bounce
          notifications.  This has the effect that no more messages are sent
          to that subscription, while the subscription is still present in the
          database. [nouri]
        
        - Added caching to composer rendering.  Caching is done based on
          ``_vars`` and collected items.  Notice that ``composer._vars`` has
          been split into two; ``_vars`` and ``_subscription_vars``. The
          latter containing variables that are likely to be unique to the
          subscription, and the former those that are likely shared across
          multiple subscriptions.
        
          Rendering is now broken into two step:
        
          1) Rendering the ``composer-html`` template and compacting the
             resulting html with StoneAgeHTML.  ``_vars`` and collected items
             is available in the template.  This step is cached on ``_vars``
             and items.
        
          2) ``string.Template`` variable replacement on the html of variables
             in ``_subscription_vars``.  In the default implementation only
             the subscribers secret in the subscription management urls is
             replaced.
        
          [tmog]
        
        Version 0.7.7 - 2008-11-05
        --------------------------
        
        - Set ``ignoreContext = True`` for SubscriptionsSearchForm.  Before
          I'd get ``AttributeError: 'ManageSubscriptionsForm' object has no
          attribute 'fulltext'``, but strangely enough not in the tests and
          only in one installation that I know of.  [nouri]
        
        Version 0.7.6 - 2008-11-05
        --------------------------
        
        - German translation has been updated.
          [saily]
        
        - Used i18ndude to find all untranslated msgid's. There were some updates in
          collective.dancing queue-button-naming, so all guy's please help updating
          collective.dancing's po files.  [saily]
        
        - Fixed a bug where when sending a preview we were incorrectly setting
          the ``cue`` of the subscription that the preview is sent to. [nouri]
        
        - Fix #264990: When sending out a newsletter from a content item
          manually, we no longer assemble all message in the course of the
          browser request.  Instead, we schedule a job that's executed
          asynchronously on ``tick_and_dispatch`` time. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.7.5 - 2008-10-27
        --------------------------
        
        - Move file locking from queue dispatch to the ``tick_and_dispatch``
          browser view.  This is to make sure that we don't put duplicates
          into the queue.  This is because the underlying queue implementation
          will actually work against us here by allowing simultaneous adds in
          parallel ZODB- writes. [nouri]
        
        - Fix #289779: Strip whitespace from e-mail addresses. [nouri]
        
        - Added ``encoding`` attribute on the ``HTMLComposer`` class to make
          it possible to either subclass and provide a different default
          encoding, or set a persistent attribute. [malthe]
        
        - Fix #280338: Images in header and footer text were sent with
          relative URLs. [nouri]
        
        - It's now possible to filter channels from the sendnewsletter view.
          Simple by setting channel.sendable=False.
          [tmog]
        
        - Fixed an issue with installing collective.dancing from python.
          The event-listener registering ISalt on creation of a new tool
          no longer depends upon having a request. [tmog]
        
        - zope.conf configuration with Virtual Host added in
          documentation [macadames]
        
        Version 0.7.4 - 2008-09-19
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix an issue where confirming pending subscriptions by visiting the "My
          subscriptions" page.  If a subscription is already confirmed the dictionary
          ``subscription.metadata`` does not have a key ``pending``.  [saily]
        
        Version 0.7.3 - 2008-09-16
        --------------------------
        
        - Rebuild ``collective.dancing.pot`` and updated German
          translation. [saily]
        
        - Removed bug in ``ManageSubscriptionsForm.remove``. When the search box
          was added we also changed the ``ManageSubscriptionsForm.get_items`` method
          to return the secret instead of the name. The remove method was not updated,
          and delete of subscriptions did not work. [saily]
        
        - Removed bug in CSV-export. Export must have same ordered fields or
          columns as expected on import. As we are using the composer schema
          for import, we should use this for export too. [saily]
        
        - Make CSV export and import use the same delimiter.
          [saily]
        
        Version 0.7.2 - 2008-09-15
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix an issue where the scheduled send-out would send out items in
          their short form, i.e. only title and description.  [miziodel, nouri]
        
        - Add a search box to the subscriptions administration view.
        
          Prior versions of S&D didn't populate the subscribers fulltext index
          correctly.  This version adds an upgrade step that you'll need to
          run in order to reindex all your subscription objects.
        
          Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how to run upgrades.
          [nouri]
        
        - Allow pending subscriptions to be conformed by visiting the "My
          subscriptions" page.  This allows users to confirm their
          subscriptions even if they've lost or never received their message
          for confirm.  [nouri]
        
        - More fine-tuning of the ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter``: Strip unwanted
          content like the review history in a configurable way.  [nouri]
        
        Version 0.7.1 - 2008-09-05
        --------------------------
        
        - Added workaround for a bug in the composer where ``header_text`` or
          ``footer_text`` are ``None``.  No idea why they're ``None``, though.
        
        Version 0.7.0 - 2008-09-05
        --------------------------
        
        - Added a new field ``subject`` for the composer.  This allows more
          control over what subject outgoing messages have, using string
          templates.  The default is ``${site_title}: ${channel_title}``.
        
          Removed the ``<h1>`` from the default composer template.  You can
          now use the ``header text`` of the composer to the same effect.  The
          default header text has now become ``<h1>${subject}</h1>`` to mimic
          the old behaviour.
        
          On the API side of things, I changed the signature of
          ``dancing.composer.HTMLComposer._vars``.  Since overriding this is
          the recommended way of providing your own variables, this warrants a
          0.7.0 release.  I'm thinking about adding a little variable provider
          component as an alternative to subclassing.
          [nouri]
        
        - Added missing header with containing style and title tag in
          ``composer-html-forgot.pt`` and ``composer-html-confirm.pt``.
          [saily]
        
        Version 0.6.5 - 2008-09-04
        --------------------------
        
        - Add header and footer fields for the composer and its form.  This
          allows us to add text at the beginning and at the end of messages in
          an easy and consistent way. [nouri]
        
        - Fix #264694: Using non ASCII characters in context title
          of send-newsletter raises ``UnicodeEncodeError``. [saily]
        
        - Make ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter`` even more robust by switching to
          using ``BeautifulSoup`` instead of ``str.find`` to parse the
          contents. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.4 - 2008-09-03
        --------------------------
        
        - Added a default ITransform adapter for S&D called
          ``dancing.transform.URL``.  This will rewrite relative links and the
          like automatically.  Relative links were the cause of broken links
          and images in the outgoing messages.  This fixes #262633.
        
          What this transform also allows is the definition of one or more
          backend URLs that it should replace by a canonical URL.  See
          ``transform.txt`` for details. [tmog, nouri]
        
        - Fix #262612: The Reply-To field is not included as message header.
        
        Version 0.6.3 - 2008-09-01
        --------------------------
        
        - Have the S&D SMTPMailer subclass from zope.sendmail's.  This allows
          the use of TLS with the standard configuration and fixes #263271.
        
        Version 0.6.2 - 2008-08-28
        --------------------------
        
        - Updated docs with information on how to configure
          ``mail:queuedDelivery`` of ``zope.sendmail``. [nouri]
        
        - Make the ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter`` which is the fallback formatter
          for all objects more robust. [tmog]
        
        - Improve internationalization with newsletter object titles. [tmog]
        
        - Fixed a bug in csv-export if you use more composer_data than just
          email address. [saily]
        
        - Some people have reported that S&D is sending out duplicate mails on
          high-traffic newsletters.  I've added a ``StubSMTPMailer`` utility,
          which you can register conveniently in
          ``collective/dancing/mail.zcml``.  No mail will be sent out when
          it's configured instead of the default one.  This allows you to
          debug and fine-tune settings, e.g. those of your configured
          ``mail:queuedDelivery`` component. [nouri]
        
        - Changed batch_size in browser/channel.py to 30 to stay at Plone's
          default. [saily]
        
        - German translation updated. [saily]
        
        - Rebuild of collective.dancing.pot using i18ndude. Some translation
          updates needed. [saily]
        
        Version 0.6.1 - 2008-08-22
        --------------------------
        
        - On reinstall, advise QuickInstaller not to delete the five.intid
          tool that we set up during installation.  This fixes the brokenness
          of the subscription catalogs after a reinstall.  A typical error
          you'd see would look like::
        
            ...
             Module collective.singing.subscribe, line 227, in subscription_modified
             Module collective.singing.subscribe, line 214, in _catalog_subscription
             Module five.intid.intid, line 36, in getId
             Module zope.app.intid, line 86, in getId
            KeyError: SimpleSubscription ...
        
          No migration is available at this point.  Contact us if you need
          help writing one.  Note that the use of QuickInstaller
          reinstallation isn't required with Singing & Dancing.  For how to
          run upgrades from one version to the next, please see the Upgrade_
          section.  A QuickInstaller reinstallation will not run these
          upgrades for you.  [nouri]
        
        Version 0.6.0 - 2008-08-21
        --------------------------
        
        - Update to use Singing's new IMessageAssemble API. [nouri]
        
        - Use batching for the subscriptions management view.  Also, reshuffle
          the order of tabs in the channel administration view.  Most notably:
          move the "Subscriptions" tab to the first position to allow more
          comfortable editing. [nouri]
        
        Version 0.5.1 - 2008-08-15
        --------------------------
        
        - Fixed a bug where a collector would have a ``Title`` property; this
          should be a method. [malthe]
        
        - Added permissions to send, preview and manage newsletter. No upgrade
          steps required - just reinstall. By default - send and preview is
          allowed to reviewer and manager role, manage newsletters for
          managers only. [saily]
        
        Version 0.5.0 - 2008-07-29
        --------------------------
        
        - Display a more user friendly error message when the user attempts to
          add duplicate subscriptions.
          [miziodel, nouri]
        
        - List of subscribers can now be uploaded and downloaded in CSV format!
          [skatja]
        
        - Depend on 0.3 or higher of plone.app.z3cform.
          [nouri]
        
        Version 0.4.1 - 2008-07-23
        --------------------------
        
        - Fix ``RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`` error in
          ``Module collective.dancing.browser.portlets.channelsubscribe, line
          253, in channel`` when displaying portlets that were created prior
          to 0.4b4.
          [nouri]
        
        Version 0.4 - 2008-07-23
        ------------------------
        
        New features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Added subject, confirmation_subject and forgot_secret_subject to
          vars of composer for easy customization.  Defaults are unchanged.
          [tmog]
        
        - Added sender name, sender address and reply-to address as per
          composer configuration. Composer configuration is now available
          in the new Composers fieldset of the channel edit view.
          [tmog]
        
        - Allow for easier subclassing of HTMLComposer.  The ``_vars()``
          method is now more generally applicable and easily to override.
          [nouri]
        
        - Made adding thirdparty Channels possible. This works the same as
          with Collectors - you simply implement you custom channel and add
          a factory to the collective.dancing.channel.channels list.
          Preview and edit forms are now class methods on ManageChannelView
          to make it easier to subclass for your custom channels.
          [tmog]
        
        - Pass on raw item as received from the collector to the composer
          (template).  Making use of this raw item will obviously bind the
          implementation of the composer to that of the collector.  However,
          it's considered useful for custom implementations that need total
          control and that know what collector they'll be using.
        
          This required an API change in IComposer.render(); the ``items``
          argument is now a list of 2-tuples instead of a list of formatted
          items.
          [nouri]
        
        - Added Polish translation by Barbara Struk
          [naro]
        
        - Added another type of scheduler: TimedScheduler.  This one allows to
          schedule a number of send-outs with an exact datetime.  Its main use
          is for the "send newsletter" form on a context where we want to
          specify a send-out date in the future.
          [nouri]
        
        - The confirmation view will now confirm pending subscriptions to any
          channel.  This saves us from having to send a separate confirmation
          e-mail for every channel a user subscribes to.  This feature isn't
          used anywhere in S&D core at this point, but it's useful if you're
          writing custom subscription forms.

        - Added SubjectsCollectorBase template class that you can use to
          create a collector based on a vocabulary.  This vocabulary may come
          from anywhere, like from ATVocabularyManager or from the list of all
          subjects/tags available in your site.
          [nouri]
        
        - Text fields will now per default not be included in the resulting
          message if there are no sibling collectors that produced items.
          E.g. if you have a heading text and a sibling topic collector, the
          heading won't appear if the topic didn't return any items.

        Bugfixes
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - Updated installation instructions to use the ``fake-zope-eggs``
          feature of the ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` instead of
          ``fakezope2eggs``.  Also, added ``skip-fake-eggs`` to accommodate
          latest changes in ``plone.z3cform``.
        
        - Use ``CompositeQueue`` instead of the simple zc.queue.Queue for
          queueing and archiving mails.  This should help with memory bloat
          when there's a lot of messages in the queue.
          [nouri]
        
        - Don't attempt to do any workflow transition with ATTopic items
          created in the collector; the default workflow will do fine, and we
          avoid errors when using workflows other than the default one.
          [nouri]
        
        - Don't bail if no items are available for preview.

        Version 0.3 - 2008-06-03
        ------------------------
        
        New features
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        - Add translations to German.
          [saily]
        
        - Added preview also to channel view.  This was previously only
          available for the "send as newsletter" action.
          [malthe]
        
        - Refactored channels management view and the dedicated channel view.
          Big improvements to usability of the channel view.
          [malthe]
        
        - Added capability to embed stylesheets in outgoing mail.  Right now,
          this is a simple text field that can be set on the channel's composer.
          We're now making use of the StoneAgeHTML library to embed styles in
          the individual HTML elements instead of providing styles in the
          ``<head>`` of the HTML document.  This gives us much better support
          with quirky e-mail clients out there.
          [malthe]
        
          In the future, we want to extend this to allow administrators to
          select themes for individual channels by browsing and selecting from a
          list of registered styles.
        
        - Added Czech translation.
          [naro]
        
        - Refactored ``mail.py`` to create ``MIMEMultipart`` based messages.
          This allows us to easily adapt the mail sending process to embed
          images and the like.
          [naro]
        
        - Added a "reference collector".  This allows you to select individual
          portal items to be sent out, as opposed to items collected by a Smart
          Folder or the like.
          [malthe]
        
        Bugfixes
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        - S&D 0.3b2 introduced an incompatible change with channels created in
          0.3b1 and earlier.  I added a GenericSetup upgrade step to fix this.
          The relevant code is in the ``collective.dancing.upgrade`` module.
        
          If you're using a legacy database with channels that were created
          before version 0.3b2, you'll need to run this upgrade step, or
          you'll see this error::
        
            TypeError: ('object.__new__(HTMLComposer) is not safe, use persistent.Persistent.__new__()', <function _reconstructor at ...>, (<class 'collective.dancing.composer.HTMLComposer'>, <type 'object'>, None))
        
          Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how to run upgrades.
          [nouri]
        
        - Add ``metadata.xml`` to make QuickInstaller happy with version
          numbers.
          [naro]
        
        - Back to using checkboxes for multi selection instead of ``select``.
          [nouri]
        
        - Make HTMLComposer and channel.composers persistent so that changes
          to template and composers are conveniently persisted.
          [nouri]
        
        - Use ``zc.lockfile`` to lock the queue processing (sending out of mail)
          instead of excessively using ``transaction.commit()``, which caused
          massive ZODB bloat when a lot of messages were involved.
          [nouri]
        
        - Use ``email.Header`` for message header formatting.  This allows for
          better internationalization in headers of outgoing e-mails.
          [naro]
        
        - In-browser preview now displays what would really be sent out,
          i.e. after collectors and transforms could do their thing.  Before, it
          used to only display the context item as mail.
          [malthe]
        
        Version 0.2 - 2008-05-06
        ------------------------
        
        - Add an 'Already subscribed?" section to the "My subscriptions"
          page to retrieve your password.
          [nouri]
        
        - added i18n:domain to browser/controlpanel-links.pt, removed extra quotes
          from browser/channel.py, updated pot and danish translation
          [bartholdy]
        
        - updated .pot and danish translation
          [bartholdy]
        
        - apparently triplequoted strings do not get translated ..
          this takes care of
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/218448
          [bartholdy]
        
        - Don't use locale-dependent 'string.letters' when creating the
          ISalt utility.  This fixes
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/217823
          [nouri]
        
        - Extended portlet with optinal footertext
          [bartholdy]
        
        - Added functionality to show a preview in the browser
