% This produces the Apeman logo from the Ape.jpg file. This is
% done as follows :
%
% * Create a Gray Scale image of the original using either
%     convert ape.jpg -colorspace grayscale ape_bw.bmp 
%   or
%     convert ape.jpg -type grayscale ape_bw.bmp 
% * Convert from Gray Scale to Monochrome 
%     convert ape_bw.jpg -threshold 35% ape_mo.bmp 
% * Next compile this PDF and convert the output file to the logo.png file
%     convert -density 600 logo.pdf logo.png
% * To create an Icon use the following line
%     convert logo.png -define icon:auto-resize=64,48,32,16 logo.ico
%
% Note that the last step produced the final pixelated image 
% that is used for the logo.
%
% I actually attempted drawing this logo by two means the first
% tries targeting clean lines for the images, the second went 
% with image mangling and gave a more rugged look which I rather
% like. There was actually a third with just a shower head as 
% our head of state is commonly depicted with this.
%
% While creating this document the following rsources were usefull.
