The cursory reader need only cover the contents upon this, the main/home page, to understand why and how one might use ApeMan.
Those wanting an introduction into how ApeMan works should read the :ref:`objective:Objective` and :ref:`import:Python's Import Mechanism` sections.
While those looking into it's implementation should read the :ref:`apeman:ApeMan`, :ref:`machinery:Machinery`, :ref:`tests:Testing` and  :ref:`contribution:Contribution` sections.
:ref:`machinery:Machinery` and :ref:`literature:Literature` discuss and provide resources for those interested in the Python import system.
The remainder of the documenation reviews the Python import system and dicusses the implementation of ApeMan within it.
