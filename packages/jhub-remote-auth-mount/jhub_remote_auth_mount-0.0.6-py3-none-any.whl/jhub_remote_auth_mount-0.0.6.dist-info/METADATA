====================================
Jupyterhub REMOTE_USER Authenticator
====================================

Authenticate to Jupyterhub using an authenticating proxy that can set
the Remote-User header.
Also supports for passing additional information to the jupyter user. This includes a
Mount header.

------------
Installation
------------

Installation from pypi::

    pip install jhub_remote_auth_mount

Installation from local git repository::

    cd jhub_remote_auth_mount
    pip install .

-------------
Configuration
-------------

You should edit your `jupyterhub_config.py` config file to set the
authenticator class::

    c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jhub_remote_auth_mount.RemoteUserAuthenticator'

You should be able to start jupyterhub.  The "/login" resource
will look for the authenticated user name in the HTTP header "Remote-User".
If found, and not blank, you will be logged in as that user.

Alternatively, you can use `RemoteUserLocalAuthenticator`::

    c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jhub_remote_auth_mount.RemoteUserLocalAuthenticator'

This provides the same authentication functionality but is derived from
`LocalAuthenticator` and therefore provides features such as the ability
to add local accounts through the admin interface if configured to do so.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Remote User Authentication extended with Mount capability
-------------------------------------------------------------

Provides the capability to supply the jupyterhub user with a set of ssh keys that can later be used to mount that particular user's homedrive, the extended authenticator can be activated by setting the following option in the jupyterhub config file::

    c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jhub_remote_auth_mount.MountRemoteUserAuthenticator'

This adds two base request paths to the jupyterhub web application::

'/login' -> requires a non empty Remote-User header
'/mount' -> requires both a non empty Remote-User and Mount header

The expected format of the Mount header is that the passed string can be evaluated to a python dictionary via::

            try:
                mount_header_dict = literal_eval(mount_header)

After being successfully evaluated to a dictionary, the header is required to contain the following information::

    {
        HOST: 'hostname of the target mount host',
        USERNAME: 'A random string that identifies an active mount session',
        PATH: 'The target URL of the system/service that grants jupyter users to mount
        their notebook against, e.g @idmc.dk:',
        MOUNTSSHPRIVATEKEY: 'private key',
    }

Note:
=====
Since we are passing private key's over the network, it is important that this information is sent over an encrypted channel, furthermore the host/service that grant this mount information should limit the validity of a keyset, e.g. can be used for 2 hours before a new set has to be generated and the old is void.
Upon successful parsing of the header, the active jupyterhub user instance is appended with a 'mount' property that contains the accepted dictionary header.
