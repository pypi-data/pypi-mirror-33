oxyba -- my wrapper functions and classes for python
====================================================

The oxyba package contains my wrapper functions and classes.

There is no particular purpose nor structure within this package.
New wrapper functions and classes are just added to main package folder.

I advise against using any of this code in production.  
Just don't.
Feel free to copy code and adjust it to your own needs. 


Installation
------------

::
    pip install oxyba


.. code:: python
    import oxyba as ob


Notes to myself
---------------
1. Update setup.py (version, requirements)
2. Update CHANGES.txt (what's added, cahnged, removed?)
3. Run:  python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi
