Description: Story Ready
        ===========
        
        Story Ready is a very simple Python library that takes a list of stories and performs a number of common readyness checks:
        
        - Acceptance Criteria: Given, When, Thens
        - User Story format: As a, I want, So that
        - Story size over percentage of velocity
        - Rank a bunch of stories by all criteria
