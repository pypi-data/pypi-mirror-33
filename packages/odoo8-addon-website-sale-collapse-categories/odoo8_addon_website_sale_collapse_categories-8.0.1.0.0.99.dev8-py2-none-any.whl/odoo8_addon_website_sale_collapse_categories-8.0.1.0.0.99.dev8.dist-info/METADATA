Collapsible product categories in website shop
==============================================

This module changes categories list to allow to collapse them.

This is a backport from Odoo v9 feature of this branch:
https://github.com/odoo-dev/odoo/tree/master-collapse-public-category-gan

Installation
============

Install the module the regular way.

Configuration
=============

On website shop page having edit permission, click on Customize, and select
"Collapse product categories" to use this feature.

Usage
=====

First level categories are shown, but collapsed by default, hidding their
children categories. Click on the down arrow to uncollapse them, and click
on a category to select it. The selected category path will remain unfolded
when loading category page.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module won't be needed on v9, because it is already part of the core
functionality, because of this PR: https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/4830.
