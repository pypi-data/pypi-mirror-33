LONG_DESCRIPTION = 'A lexicon is a data-structure which stores a set of words. ' \
                   'The difference between a dictionary and a lexicon is that in a lexicon there are no values associated with the words. ' \
                   'A lexicon is similar to a list of words or a set, but the internal representation is different and optimized for faster searches(of words, prefixes and wildcard patterns). ' \
                   'Precisely the search time is O(W) where W is the length of the word. ' \
                   'Lexpy is pure python package which implements 2 important lexicon Data-structures Trie and Directed' \
