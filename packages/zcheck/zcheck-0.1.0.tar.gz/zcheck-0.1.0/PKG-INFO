Description: # zenko-check
        
        zenko-check is a command-line utility to check the configuration of a
        production Zenko deployment and diagnose problems in it.
        
        ## Pre-Requisites
        
        zenko-check requires a [Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) installation
        that is configured to access Tiller running inside Kubernetes.
        
        ## Installation
        
        zenko-check can be installed directly from PyPi using Pip:
        
        ```
        pip install zenko-check
        ```
        
        A Docker image is also provided for convenience.
        
        ```
        docker pull zenko/zenko-check:latest
        docker run -it zenko/zenko-check help
        ```
        
        ## Syntax
        
        zenko-check commands conform to the following syntax:
        
        ```
        zenko-check <global option> <subcommand> <-flag or --verbose_option> <optional target>
        ```
