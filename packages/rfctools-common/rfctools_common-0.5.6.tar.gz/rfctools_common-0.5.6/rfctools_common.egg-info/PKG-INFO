Description: RFC Editor Tools Utility Code
        =============================
        
        This module contains a set of utility functions used by some of the RFC Editor tools.
        Long term, the goal is to incorperate these functions back into xml2rfc but having it
        separate allows for an easier modification of the functions as needed.

        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Copy the cache code in for URLs on .dtd and .ent files, this allows for
        	  a DTD to be grabbed from the network
        	* Switch to using resolve_string in those cases where we have cached the file
        	  so that futher includes have the correct path when getting resolved.
