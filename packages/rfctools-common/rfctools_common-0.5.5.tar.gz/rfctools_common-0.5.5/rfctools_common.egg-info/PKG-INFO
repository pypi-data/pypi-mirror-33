Description: RFC Editor Tools Utility Code
        =============================
        
        This module contains a set of utility functions used by some of the RFC Editor tools.
        Long term, the goal is to incorperate these functions back into xml2rfc but having it
        separate allows for an easier modification of the functions as needed.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 0.5.5 (Tue 12 JUNE)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Correct problem with displaying utf8 strings
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.5.3 (Fri XX APR)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Copy the cache code in for URLs on .dtd and .ent files, this allows for
        	  a DTD to be grabbed from the network
        	* Switch to using resolve_string in those cases where we have cached the file
        	  so that futher includes have the correct path when getting resolved.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 0.5.2 (Fri 30 MAR)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
        	* Distribute the old rfc 2629 dtd and ent files so that v2 files parse correctly
        	* Correct processing so that we can play games with where to search file files.
        	  If the file does not exist and the source directory is given then strip the
        	  path so that we will search in different directories for the file.
