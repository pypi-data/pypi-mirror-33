tidynamics

- performs the computation of mean-square displacements and correlation functions.
- accepts as input NumPy arrays storing the positions and velocities of particles.
- implements the so-called Fast Correlation Algorithm proposed by Kneller and others for the
  `nMOLDYN <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/nmoldyn/>`_ analysis program.
- depends only `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.

For a quick jump into tidynamics, have a look at the examples.

Goals and plans:

- Minimal dependencies.
- Serve as a reference implementation for common algorithms that are useful for molecular
  and stochastic simulations.
- Provide later a bit more flexibility to handle cross correlations and many-body systems.


Installation
------------

It is necessary to have Python and NumPy to install and use tidynamics.

tidynamics can be installed with pip::

    pip install --user tidynamics

It is also possible to download the source code and execute the setup.py file.

I ran the tests with Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6 and NumPy 1.11 and 1.13. If you encounter any
issue, let me know (see Contact below).

Testing
-------

We use `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest/>`_ for testing::

    python -m pytest
