Detailed Installation Instructions for Ginga
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

===========
Dependences
===========

Ginga is written entirely in Python, and only uses supporting Python
packages.  There is nothing to compile (unless you need to compile one
of the supporting packages).

On recent Linux, Mac and Windows versions, all of the packages are
available in binary (installable) form.  It should not be necessary 
to compile anything, but as always, your mileage may vary.

REQUIRED
========

* python (either v. 2.7 **OR** v. 3.4 or higher)
* numpy  (v. 1.7 or higher)

Highly recommended, because some features will not be available without it:

* scipy
* pillow
* opencv

For opening `FITS <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_ files you will 
need one of the following packages:

* astropy
* fitsio

For `WCS <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html>`_ resolution 
you will need one of the following packages:

* astropy
* kapteyn
* astLib
* starlink

BACKENDS (one or more)
======================
Ginga can draw its output to a number of different back ends.
Depending on which GUI toolkit you prefer (and what you want to
do), you will need at least one of the following:

* python-qt4
* python-qt5
* python-pyside (qt4 alternative)
* python-gtk (gtk2) **AND** python-cairo
* python gtk3 (gi) **AND** python-cairo
* python-Tkinter
* matplotlib
* tornado
* aggdraw
* PIL (pillow)
* OpenCv

RECOMMENDED
===========
Certain plugins in the reference viewer (or features of those plugins)
will not work without the following packages:

* matplotlib (required by: Pick, Cuts, Histogram, LineProfile)
* webkit (required by: WBrowser (used for online help))
* scipy (required by: Pick, some built-in `auto cuts algorithms <http://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/operation.html#automatically-setting-cut-levels>`_ 
  used when you load an image)
* astropy (required by: SAMP)

To save a movie:

* mencoder (required by: Cuts)

Helpful, but not necessary (may optimize or speed up certain operations):

* python-opencv (speeds up rotation, mosaicing and some transformations)
* python-pyopencl (speeds up rotation, mosaicing and some transformations)
* python-numexpr (speeds up rotation a little)
* python-filemagic (aids in identifying files when opening them)
* python-PIL or pillow (useful for various RGB file manipulations)

==============================
Notes on Supported Widget Sets
==============================

In the discussion below, we differentiate between the Ginga viewing
widget, such as used in the ``examples/\*/example\*.py`` programs and the 
full reference viewer, which includes many plugins (``scripts/ginga``).

.. note:: For the full reference viewer, Mac and Windows users
	  should probably install the Qt version, unless you are
	  the tinkering sort.  Linux can use either Qt or Gtk fine.

Qt/PySide
=========

Ginga can use either PyQt or PySide, version 4 or 5.  It will auto-detect
which one is installed.  There is support for both the basic widget and
the full reference viewer.

.. note:: If you have both installed and you want to use a specific one
	  then set the environment variable QT_API to either "pyqt" or
	  "pyside".  This is the same procedure as for Matplotlib.


Gtk
===

Ginga can use either Gtk 2 (with pygtk) or gtk 3 (with gi).  (If you have
an older version of pycairo package you may need to install a newer version
from github.com/pygobject/pycairo).


Tk
===

Ginga's Tk support is limited to the viewing widget itself.  For
overplotting (graphics) support, you will also need:

* "pillow"/PIL package
* "OpenCv" module
* "aggdraw" module (which you can find 
  `here <https://github.com/ejeschke/aggdraw>`_ ; supports Python 2 
  only).

Matplotlib
==========

Ginga can render directly into a Matplotlib figure.  Support is limited
to the viewing widget itself.  Any of the backends that Matplotlib
supports is usable.  Performance is not as good as to one of the
"native" backends listed above, but oh, the overplot options!

HTML5 web browser
=================

Ginga can render into an HTML5 canvas via a web server.  Support is limited
to the viewing widget itself.  See the notes in ``example/pg/example1_pg.py``.
Tested browsers include Chromium (Chrome), Firefox,  and Safari.

========================
Installation from Source
========================

#. Clone from github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga.git

   Or see links on `this page <http://ejeschke.github.io/ginga/>`_
   to get a zip or tar ball.

#. Unpack, go into the top level directory, and run::

    $ python setup.py install

   The reference viewer can then be run using the command ``ginga``.

Alternatively you can download and install via `pip`::

    $ pip install ginga

==============================
Platform Specific Instructions
==============================

Linux
=====

#. Install the necessary dependences.  If you are on a relatively recent
   version of Ubuntu (e.g. v14.04 or later), something like the following
   will work::

     $ apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
       python-astropy python-qt4 python-webkit python-magic git pip

   Or::

     $ apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib \
       python-astropy python-gtk python-cairo python-webkit \
       python-magic git pip

   (if you want to use the Gtk version)

#. Install ginga with pip::

     $ pip install ginga

   or by obtaining the source and installing as described above.


Mac
===

#. For Mac users, we recommend installing the
   `Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_.
   This distribution already includes all of the necessary packages to run
   Ginga.

   As an alternative, you also have the choice of Enthought Canopy.  The
   `free version <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_ works fine.
   After installing this, open the Canopy package manager, search for
   "astropy" and install it.  Also search for and install "pyside"
   (free version of Qt bindings).

#. After installing one of these distributions, open a Terminal and
   install Ginga via "pip install ginga".  You can then run the reference
   viewer via the command "ginga".

.. note:: Ginga can be installed and run fine using a working Macports or 
          Homebrew installation.  Simply follow the package advice given 
	  above under the Linux instructions.

Windows
=======

Anaconda
````````

For Windows users, we recommend installing the
`Anaconda distribution <http://continuum.io/downloads>`.
This distribution already includes all of the necessary packages to run
Ginga.
  
After installing Anaconda, you can find the reference viewer script as::

   Start -> All Programs -> Anaconda -> Anaconda Command Prompt
   pythonw Scripts\ginga

Enthought Canopy
````````````````

As an alternative, you also have the choice of Enthought Canopy.

#. Install the `free version <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_.
#. Open the Canopy package manager.
#. Search for and install "astropy".
#. Search for and install "pyside" (free version of Qt bindings).

   Start -> All Programs -> Enthought Canopy -> Canopy command prompt
   pip install ginga
   pythonw AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy\User\Scripts\ginga
