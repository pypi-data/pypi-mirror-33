Tax chart for a period interval
===============================

Regular tax chart wizard lets you select only one period. With this module,
you can select an initial and ending period, and you will get taxes data
for that interval.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* sum_period compute logic has been completely overwritten when coming from
  tax chart wizard because there is no provided hook or facility, so changes
  in the computation upstream (unlikely, but possible) will not be reflected
  with this module.
