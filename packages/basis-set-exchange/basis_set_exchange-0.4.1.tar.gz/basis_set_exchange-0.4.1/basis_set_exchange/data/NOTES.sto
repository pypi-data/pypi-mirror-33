Notes about STO basis sets
============================

STO basis sets are formed by fitting a set of 2/3/4/5/6 exponents/coefficients to
a corresponding Slater function. A set of elements (first row main group, for example)
will share a set of coefficients and a common set of 'base' exponents which are
multiplied by an element-specific scaling factor.

In general, all STO basis sets share a common set of papers.

hehre1969a - Original exponents/scaling factors for H, Li-F

hehre1970a - Adds exponents/scaling for Na-Ar. Also has scaling factors
             for He and Ne, and fixes the scaling factors for Li, Be, and B.
             Since these elements derive from both hehre1969a and 1970a,
             they have both references

pietro1980a - All info for K, Ca, Ga-Kr
pietro1981a - All info for Rb, Sr, and In-Xe
pietro1983a - Scaling factors for Sc-Zn and Y-Cd. These are combined
              with the exponents/coefficients from pietro1980a and pietro 1981a


Note that pietro1983a only specifically deals with STO-3G. However, the scaling
factors appear to be applied also to the exponents/coefficients for 2G/4G/5G/6G.


Difference with GAMESS
----------------------

GAMESS uses a different scaling factor Na-Cl, so these are split into
a separate basis set for our purposes. The modified scaling factors come
from gordon1978a.
