Cryptoran is a Python3 based cryptographic algorithms library. It implements block ciphers, public key crypto algorithms and key exchange protocols. It is not safe right now and I would NOT suggest using it for sensitive material. I am developing the library for educational purposes only. Feel free to contribute and tinker around with the library.

Happy encrypting!
