        What is BorgWeb?
        ================
        
        BorgWeb is a browser-based user interface for `Borg Backup <https://borgweb.readthedocs.io/>`_.
        
        The UI is intended to help with everyday tasks, it is not intended as a full UI to everything borg can do.
        
        You'll need help of an admin to install and configure it, as well as to restore backups.
        
        Main features
        -------------
        
        - BorgWeb (the web service) usually runs on the machine that is backed up with
          BorgBackup. You can use a web browser to access BorgWeb from the same
          machine or from another machine.
        - BorgWeb can operate using a builtin web server or as WSGI app using an
          external web server (like e.g. apache + mod_wsgi).
        - using the web browser you can:
        
          * review backup log files
          * start a backup
