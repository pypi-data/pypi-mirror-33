devpi-server: pypi server for caching and private indexes
=============================================================================

* `issue tracker <https://github.com/devpi/devpi/issues>`_, `repo
  <https://github.com/devpi/devpi>`_

* IRC: #devpi on freenode, `mailing list
  <https://mail.python.org/mm3/mailman3/lists/devpi-dev.python.org/>`_ 

* compatibility: {win,unix}-py{27,34,35,36,py}

consistent robust pypi-cache
============================

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
**and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.

user specific indexes
=====================

Each user (which can represent a person or a project, team) can have
multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``setup.py``
invocations command.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through a
RESTful HTTP API.

index inheritance
=================

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.

good defaults and easy deployment
=================================

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 

separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
==============================================

The complementary `devpi-client <https://pypi.org/project/devpi-client/>`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See https://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.

.. towncrier release notes start

4.6.0 (2018-07-13)
==================

Features
--------

- implement #448: allow deletion of single release files.

- implement #530: set caching headers for release files to expire far in the
  future.

- implement #535: Generate absolute URLs on project simple index pages when
  ``--absolute-urls`` option is used or ``X-DEVPI-ABSOLUTE-URLS`` header is
  set.

- add `--max-request-body-size` option to control maximum upload size

- add `--request-timeout` option to provide adjustable request timeout


Bug Fixes
---------

- fix #549: reduce timeout for requests to PyPI etc from 30 to 5 seconds. This
  can be changed with the ``--request-timeout`` option.

- fix raising of UpstreamError by using correct ``status_code`` attribute of
  response instead of not existing ``status``.

- Fix cumulating log tags for request numbers by wrapping the responsible code
  in a try/finally block to always remove the tag, even when there was an
  exception.


4.5.0 (2018-05-04)
==================

Features
--------

- add ``devpiserver_on_remove_file`` hook to handle removal of files in
  plugins. Thanks to Dr Colin Kong for the PR.

Bug Fixes
---------

- adjust minimum version of pyramid to 1.8 (related to #430)

  keyword.
