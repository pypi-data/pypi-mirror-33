Description: # PyEnvirons
        
        "PyEnvirons" is a higher level API of pygame to easily design, devolop and debug environments for your unsupervised AI agent. It is under rapid development and features will be added almost every single day.
        
        ## Usage and examples
        
        To show you how simple PyEnvirons is here is a example.
        
        ### Creating a functional window
        
        ```python
        from Core import PyEnviron #Importing PyEnviron library
        
        screen = PyEnviron.Window([800, 600], 'testwindow')
        #Instantiating the window class to make a window, by specifying the size and name of the window
        
        app = PyEnviron.App(screen) #Instantiating the app class by giving the app our window
        
        app.run() #running our app
        ```
        
        ### Using sprites, gameobjects and layers
        ```python
        from Core import PyEnviron #Importing the PyEnviron library
        screen = PyEnviron.Window([800, 600], 'testwindow')
        #Instantiating the window class to make a window, by specifying the size and name of the window
        
        app = PyEnviron.App(screen) #Instantiating the app class by giving the app our window
        
        image = PyEnviron.Sprite('PyEnviron/SpriteTests/2635d6c2b056dfb.png') #Loading a sprite for our use by specfying a file path
        
        layer = PyEnviron.Layer() #Instantiating a layer for us to put sprites into
        
        #The gameobject class, will have all the variables regarding the sprite, like the image, position, rotation, and script attached to it.
        gm = PyEnviron.GameObject(image) #Instantiating a gameobject for us to use by giving it our sprite, position, rotation and scale are [0, 0], 0 degrees and [1, 1], respectivly, by defualt.
        
        layer.add_gameobject(gm) #Adding our game object to the layer
        
        app.add_layer(layer) #Adding the layer to our app
        
        app.run()#Running the app
        ```
