        ## Best Practice
        
        Firstly, create a python file: c:\folder\mytest.py
        
            # c:\folder\mytest.py
            from data4test import timestamp4test
            print(timestamp4test.get_this_week_head_timestamp())
            print(timestamp4test.get_this_week_end_timestamp())
            print(timestamp4test.get_this_month_head_timestamp())
            print(timestamp4test.get_this_month_end_timestamp())
            print(timestamp4test.get_chinese_this_week_head_timestamp())
            print(timestamp4test.get_chinese_this_week_end_timestamp())
            
        then use your IDE to run this script or 
        
            $ python c:\folder\mytest.py
