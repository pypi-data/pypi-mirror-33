Install
-------

aioitertools requires Python 3.6 or newer.
You can install it from PyPI:

    $ pip3 install aioitertools


Usage
-----

aioitertools shadows the standard library whenever possible to provide
asynchronous version of the modules and functions you already know.  It's
fully compatible with standard iterators and async iterators alike, giving
you one unified,Â familiar interface for interacting with iterable objects:

    from aioitertools import iter, next, map, zip

    something = iter(...)
    first_item = await next(something)

    async for item in iter(something):
        ...


    async def fetch(url):
        response = await aiohttp.request(...)
        return response.json

    async for value in map(fetch, MANY_URLS):
        ...


    async for a, b in zip(something, something_else):
        ...
