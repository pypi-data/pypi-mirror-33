        =============
        
        stochasticity provides various means of getting randomness. At this time 
        there is only a coin flip feature. Other forms of randomness in the 
        future could include latitude/longitude, colors, music
        notes, and so on. (Not intended to replace Faker)
        Example::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
            from stochasticity.coin.coin import Coin
