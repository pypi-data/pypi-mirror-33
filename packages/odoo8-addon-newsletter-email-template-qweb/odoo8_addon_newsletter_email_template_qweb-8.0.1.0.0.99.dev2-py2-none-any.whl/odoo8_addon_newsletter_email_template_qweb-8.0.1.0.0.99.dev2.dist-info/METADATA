===============================
QWeb expressions in newsletters
===============================

This module was written to allow QWeb expressions in newsletters. This
allows users for example to personalize greetings.

Installation
============

The module should autoinstall when you install both the `email_template`
and the `newsletter` module.

Usage
=====

If your newsletter type uses an email template with templating engine QWeb,
use standard QWeb expressions on variables ``object`` (a browse record on
the current recipient object) and ``newletter`` (a browse record of the
currently rendered newsletter).
