============================
Website Portal for Purchases
============================

This module adds the partner's purchase documents in the frontend portal.
Suppliers will be able to see the list and state of their request for
quotations, purchase orders and supplier invoices.

.. warning::
    "Purchases" term here refers to your company's POV about purchases. That
    means this module actually creates a portal *for your suppliers*.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Assign auth user group to the user.
2. If you install 'portal_sale' you can invite user to access it.
3. User can access to his request quotations, orders and supplier invoices
   from his account in user account link.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Tests.
* When migrating to v10, we will have to base this module on ``website_portal``
  directly.
* If you want to display invoices, you will have to install
  ``website_portal_sale_v10``, which displays both customer and supplier
  invoices merged in the same place.

  * If you do not want both kinds of invoices merged in the same controller,
    install ``website_portal_invoice_separated``.
