        ## Installation
        
        1. **Install a headless browser**  
        A headless browser is required for this tool to automate web page interaction. The browser used here is PhantomJS. Install it using npm.  
            `sudo npm install phantomjs-prebuilt`  
        ***Note: Do not install phantomjs-prebuilt globally. Install it locally i.e don't use -g in the npm command***
        
        2. **Install the package**  
            * **Using pip**  
            `sudo pip3 install getcomic`  
        
            * **From source**   
                1. Clone this repo and navigate to this folder in your machine.  
                2. Install phantomjs-prebuilt in this directory.  
                3. Install using the following commands now.   
                    `python3 setup.py build`  
                    `python3 setup.py install`  
        
        ## Usage 
        
        1. After installation is done, run the command `getcomic` and provide a readcomiconline url and the name of the directory where you want to 
        download your files as arguments, as shown below.
        
        ![](commandss.png?raw=true)  
        
        The directory name you specified will be created in the home folder if not already present.
