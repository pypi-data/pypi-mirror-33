Cortex4py
=========

Cortex4py is a Python API client for
`Cortex <https://thehive-project.org/>`__, a powerful observable
analysis engine where observables such as IP and email addresses, URLs,
domain names, files or hashes can be analyzed one by one using a Web
interface.

Cortex4py allows analysts to automate these operations and submit
observables in bulk mode through the Cortex REST API from alternative
SIRP platforms, custom scripts or MISP.

Features
========

Cortex4py 2 is compatible with Cortex 2 and does not work with Cortex 1.
It can: - Manage organizations - Manage users - Configure analyzers
within an organization - List and launch analyzers

For more details, please refer to the `full documentation <Usage.md>`__.

**Note**: Cortex4py 2 requires Python 3. It does not support Python 2.

Use It
======

On macOS and Linux, type:

::

    sudo -H pip3 install cortex4py

or, if you already have it, update it:

::

    sudo -H pip3 install -U cortex4py

If you are using Python on a Windows operating system, please forgo the
``sudo`` command.
