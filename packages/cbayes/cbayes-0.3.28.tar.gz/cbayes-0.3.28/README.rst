Consistent Bayes Toolbox
========================

This library is meant to provide a straightforward implementation of the Consistent Bayesian
framework for solving Stochastic Inverse Problems.

Getting Started
===============

| It is suggested that you start with the ``examples/CBayes.ipynb`` file. This notebook walks you
  through the method and several example files equipped with rich interactive multi-dimensional
  visualizations.
| A "bare-bones" python script that carries out the same computations can be found in
  ``examples/consistentbayes_example.py``

See the ``examples/`` directory for both script and jupyter-notebook files that walk you through how
to solve stochastic inverse problems in the Consistent Bayesian framework, which was developed in
tandem by: - Dr. Troy Butler, CU Denver Dept. of Mathematics & Statistical Sciences - Dr. Timothy
Wildey, Sandia National Laboratories - Dr. Scott Walsh, and - Michael Pilosov, MS, CU Denver Dept.
of Mathematics & Statistical Sciences

You can find general overview in the explanations presented in the jupyter notebooks. \*\* As of
1/21/18, these are not yet integrated with the new object-oriented framework implemented in version
0.3.0 \*\*

For more detail, please see `this draft on arxiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00680>`__ *in review*
