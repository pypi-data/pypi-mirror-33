uAMQP for Python
================

An AMQP 1.0 client library for Python.


Installation
============

Wheels are provided for most major operating systems, so you can install directly with pip:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install uamqp


If you are running a Linux distro that does not support `ManyLinux1 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513>`__, you can install from source:

.. code:: shell

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev uuid-dev cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev pkg-config python3-dev python3-pip
    $ pip3 install uamqp --no-binary


Python 2.7 support
++++++++++++++++++
Coming soon...


Developer Setup
===============
In order to run the code directly, the Cython extension will need to be build first.

Pre-requisites
++++++++++++++

- Windows: Setup a `build environment <https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-binary-extensions/#building-binary-extensions>`__.
- Linux: Install dependencies as descriped above in the installation instructions.
- MacOS: Install cmake using Homebrew:

.. code:: shell

    $ brew install cmake

Building the extension
++++++++++++++++++++++

This project has two C library dependencies. They are vendored in this repository in these versions:

- `Azure uAMQP for C <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c>`__ @ `1.2.5 <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-c/releases/tag/1.2.5>`__
- `Azure C Shared Utility <https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility>`__ @ `1.1.5 <https://github.com/Azure/azure-c-shared-utility/releases/tag/1.1.5>`__

To build, start by creating a virtual environment and installing the required Python packages:

.. code:: shell

    $ python -m venv env
    $ env/Scripts/activate
    (env)$ pip install -r dev_requirements.txt

Next, run the build command:

.. code:: shell

    $ python setup.py built_ext --inplace

Tests
+++++

The tests can be run from within the virtual environment. The extension must be built first using the instructions above.

.. code:: shell

    (env)$ pytest


Provide Feedback
================

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the
`Issues <https://github.com/Azure/azure-uamqp-python/issues>`__
section of the project.

Release History
===============

0.1.0rc2 (2018-07-02)
+++++++++++++++++++++

- **Breaking change** Submodule `async` has been renamed to the internal `_async`.
  All asynchronous classes in the submodule can now be accessed from uamqp or uamqp.authentication directly.
- **Breaking change** Anything returned by a callback supplied to receive messages will now be ignored.
- **Breaking change** Changed message state enum values:

    - `Complete -> SendComplete`
    - `Failed -> SendFailed`
    - `WaitingForAck -> WaitingForSendAck`

- Added new message state enum values:

    - `ReceivedUnsettled`
    - `ReceivedSettled`

- **Breaking change** Changes to message settlement exceptions:

    - Combined the `AbandonMessage` and `DeferMessage` exceptions as `MessageModified` to be in keeping with the AMQP specification.
    - Renamed `AcceptMessage` to `MessageAccepted`.
    - Renamed `RejectMessage` to `MessageRejected` which now takes `condition` and `description` arguments rather than `message`.

- Added `errors.LinkDetach` exception as new subclass of `AMQPConnectionError` as a wrapped for data in a Link DETACH dispostition.
- Added `errors.LinkRedirect` as a specific subclass of `LinkDetach` to decode the specific redirect fields of a Link Redirect response.
- Added `errors.MessageAlreadySettled` exception for operations performed on a received message that has already returned a receipt dispostition.
- Added `errors.MessageReleased` exception.
- Added `errors.ErrorResponse` exception.
- A received Message can now be explicitly settled through a set of new functions on the message:

    - `Message.accept()`
    - `Message.reject(condition:str, description:str)`
    - `Message.release()`
    - `Message.modify(failed:bool, deliverable:bool, annotations:dict)`

- Added explicit `auto_complete` argument to `ReceiveClient` and `ReceiveClientAsync`. If `auto_complete` is set to `False` then all messages must be
  explicitly "accepted" or "rejected" by the user otherwise they will timeout and be released. The default is `True`, which is the exiting behaviour for each receive mechanism:

    - Received messages processed by callback (`ReceiveClient.receive_messages()`) will be automatically "accepted" if no explicit response has been set on completion of the callback.
    - Received messages processed by batch (`ReceiveClient.receive_message_batch()`) will by automatically "accepted" before being returned to the user.
    - Received messages processed by iterator (`ReceiveClient.receive_message_iter()`) will by automatically "accepted" if no explicit response has been set once the generator is incremented.

- Added new methods to clients and connections to allow to redirect to an alternative endpoint when a LinkRedirect exception is raised.
  The client redirect helper cannot be used for clients that use a shared connection - the clients must be closed before the connection can be redirected.
  New credentials must be supplied for the new endpoint. The new methods are:

    - `uamqp.Connection.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.ConnectionAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.SendClient.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.ReceiveClient.redirect(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.SendClientAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`
    - `uamqp.async.ReceiveClientAsync.redirect_async(redirect_info, auth)`

- Added `on_detach_received` argument to `Sender` and `Receiver` classes to pass in callback to run on Link DETACH.
- Removed automatic char encoding for strings of length 1, and added `types.AMQPChar` for explicit encoding.
- Bumped uAMQP C version to 1.2.5
- Bumped Azure C Shared Utility to 1.1.5
- Fixed memory leaks in MessageProperties, MessageHeader and message annotations.
