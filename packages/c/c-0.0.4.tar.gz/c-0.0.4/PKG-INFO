Description: # C
        
        This is a battery history analyZer for android and compatible systems.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        There is nothing to configure in this package, but you must configure
        your android device to output CSV files in this format:
        
            YYYY-MM-DD,HH.mm,!C,!D,!V
        
        Special formats are defined as follows:
        
        * `!C`: the capacity ("percentage") of your battery at the time, from
          0 to 100.
        * `!D`: whether your screen was on at the time, as `on` or `off`.
        * `!V`: the voltage of your battery, in microvolts. `4000000` means 4V.
