# EazeBot
## Introduction
- Have you ever traded cryptocurrencies and lost overview of your planned buys/sells?
- Have you encountered the experience that your buy order was executed while you slept, and before you could place any stop-loss, the price rushed so deep that you made huge loss?
- Have you ever complained about that there is no exchange where you can set for one and the same coin a sell order and a stop-loss at the same time?
- Have you ever had a really good trading plan but then you got greedy or anxious and messed it up?

**Then EazeBot is your man!**

EazeBot is a free Python-based Telegram bot that helps you defining an unlimited number of trade sets that will then be carried out for you via exchange APIs. 
Such a trade set is consisting of buy/sell levels and amounts and an optional stop-loss level. 
EazeBot lets you check the progress of your tradings, tells you about filled orders and triggered stop losses, and can tell your balances.
Breakout trading (set buy order if daily candle closes over price X) are supported, too. 

Most importantly: **All popular exchanges are supported!**
(for supported exchanges [see here](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt#supported-cryptocurrency-exchange-markets "ccxt supported exchanges"))


## Installing

You require Python 3 to be installed on your system.

The simpliest way of installing EazeBot is using the pip install command:
````python
python -m pip install eazebot
````
or if you want to specify an installation folder (not recommended):
````python
python -m pip install eazebot -t <directory>
````

Alternatively, you can clone or download the newest release version from [Github](https://github.com/MarcelBeining/EazeBot) 
and install required packages from the command prompt by switching to the EazeBot directory in a terminal and typing `python setup.py install` 
(or for Windows users doubleclick on _setup.bat_ in the EazeBot directory).


## Getting Started

After installation of EazeBot you have to set up the bot so that you can control him via Telegram and that he can access your exchanges. 

There are two json files that you have to configure: _APis.json_ and _botConfig.json_. 

If you used `pip install`, the jsons are in the package folder, and you can copy them to your desired folder by using Python:
````python
from eazebot.EazeBot import copyJSON
copyJSON(_yourTargetfolder_) # blank input copies them to your current Python working directory
````
If you cloned/downloaded the git files, they are located in the _eazebot_ subfolder.

**Now the following steps are necessary:**
1. **Create a Telegram bot token using @botfather and add it to _botConfig.json_**  
   + This sounds complicated but is rather simple. Start a chat with [Botfather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram and 
   follow [these instructions](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot). Once you have the token, replace 
   the *YOURBOTTOKEN* text in the *botConfig.json* file that comes with the EazeBot package (see above).
2. **Add your Telegram ID to _botConfig.json_**
   + This ensures that **only you** are able to control the bot via Telegram.
   + Simply replace the *000000000* text in *botConfig.json* with your telegram ID. This is (normally) a 9-digit number. 
   If you do not know it, simply start EazeBot bot (_see step 5_) and start a conversation with him
   (e.g. if you named your telegram bot @mysuperbot,  search for him in Telegram and click the Start button). The bot will tell you
   your Telegram ID (now you can add it to the json file) and that you are not authorized (yet). Stop the bot (e.g. ctrl+c in Python) again for now!
3. **Create API keys for each exchange you want to access via EazeBot and add them to _APIs.json_**
   + Please refer on your exchange on how to create an API token.
   + Normally, once you created an API token, you will see an API key and an API secret (sometimes also called private key).
   These two keys need to be copy-pasted into the APIs.json file from the EazeBot package. The json file already contains
   two examples on how this has to be done. Of course, if your exchange is not binance or coinbase, simply add your exchange keys analogously
   (i.e. your exchange's name is XYZ, then it should be: 
   ```apiKeyXYZ : "YOURAPIKEY",``` and ```apiSecretXYZ : "YOURAPISECRET",``` (no comma in the last line before the **}** )
   + Some exchanges also have more security factors, like a password or a uid. These are added analogously to the keys/secrets
   (i.e. your exchange's name is XYZ, then it should be: 
   ```apiPasswordXYZ : "YOURAPIPASSWORD",``` and ```apiUid : "YOURAPIUID",``` (no comma in the last line before the **}** )
   + Some exchanges allow you to determine what you can do with the created API token (e.g. read-only or no withdrawing etc.). Of course, 
   EazeBot bot needs the permission to set and cancel orders for you and to fetch your balance in order to work properly. Also, if you want
   to use the built-in donation feature, it needs the right to withdraw.
4. **Run the bot and start a conversation via Telegram.**
   + How to run depends on the way you installed EazeBot. 
   + If you used pip install, start Python, cd to the folder where you copied the JSONs too (see _Installing_ step) and run these commands:
   ````python
   from eazebot.EazeBot import startBot
   startBot()
   ````
   + If you simply cloned/downloaded the package, go to the eazebot subfolder and run EazeBot.py (double-clicking if your py files are linked to Python, or by typing `python EazeBot.py` into your command line)
   + The bot will welcome you and show you a menu of things you can do. Everything should be rather self-explanatory as the bot will have a dialog with you on everything you click.


## Help

We will add a Wiki in the future. You may also open an issue if you encounter bugs or want to suggest improvements.

## Versioning

For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/MarcelBeining/eazebot/tags/). 

From time to time you should update EazeBot by
+ Executing `python -m pip install eazebot --upgrade` if you used pip for installing
+ Or downloading the package again and overwriting the old files **(not the json files of course!)**
