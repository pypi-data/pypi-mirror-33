# aslem

aslem is an experiment manager that was primarily made for use within the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](http://asl.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, but can be used by anyone else who desires the ability to parallelize software experiments on a machine via the Linux screen utility (without the hassle of managing screen sessions themselves).

It is developed and maintained by [Boris Ivanovic](http://www.borisivanovic.com).
