This package implements a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based on Ethereum 
which provides a publicly readable ledger managed by a group of Ledger Guardians.
The implementation provides transaction processing for contracts, Proof of Authority
concensus, and management of Smart Contracts running on the ledger.
