`Release 0.6`_ (2018-07-03)
---------------------------

- **Bug fix:** Don't raise an exception in ``parse_crypttab()`` when
  ``/etc/crypttab`` doesn't exist. I ran into the exception that used to be
  raised when I ran ``upgrade-remote-system`` (in debuntu-tools_) against a
  server without any encrypted filesystems and was unpleasantly surprised that
  my "upgrade && reboot && cleanup kernels" had aborted halfway ðŸ˜‡.

- **Miscellaneous changes:** (lots of them)

  - Added this changelog and restructured the documentation.
  - Integrated ``property_manager.sphinx`` to improve documentation.
  - Minor changes to the ``setup.py`` script:

    - Added the ``license='MIT'`` key.
    - Changed alpha trove classifier to beta.
    - Added some additional trove classifiers.

  - Added usage messages of ``cryptdisks-start-fallback`` and
    ``cryptdisks-stop-fallback`` to readme.
  - Changed ``MANIFEST.in`` to include documentation in source distributions.
  - Minor improvements to documentation of ``linux_utils.cli`` module.
  - Bumped copyright to 2018.


.. _Release 0.6: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.5...0.6

`Release 0.5`_ (2017-06-24)
---------------------------

- Added ``linux_utils.atomic`` module (atomic filesystem operations).
- Expose parsed NFS information in ``FileSystemEntry`` objects.
- Test coverage improvements and minor code changes.
- Consistently define ``__all__`` for modules.

.. _Release 0.5: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.4.1...0.5

`Release 0.4.1`_ (2017-06-23)
-----------------------------

A "vanity release" to add missing links in the README because the missing links
caused PyPI to render the readme on the project page as plain text instead of
reStructuredText converted to HTML :-).

.. _Release 0.4.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.4...0.4.1

`Release 0.4`_ (2017-06-22)
---------------------------

Added the command line programs ``cryptdisks-start-fallback`` and
``cryptdisks-stop-fallback``. My reason for adding these was so that I could
refer to them in the documentation of my rsync-system-backup_ package:
`How to set up unattended backups to an encrypted USB disk
<http://rsync-system-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/encrypted-usb-disk.html#unlock-the-encrypted-disk>`_.

.. _Release 0.4: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.3...0.4

`Release 0.3`_ (2017-06-21)
---------------------------

Improved ``/etc/crypttab`` compatibility:

- Support for ``LABEL="..."`` device identifiers.
- Respect the ``/etc/crypttab`` options ``discard``, ``readonly`` and ``tries``.
- Ignore encrypted filesystems that aren't LUKS.

.. _Release 0.3: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.2...0.3

`Release 0.2`_ (2017-06-21)
---------------------------

Added a Python API for ``cryptsetup`` (to control LUKS full disk encryption)
including Python emulation of ``cryptdisks_start`` and ``cryptdisks_stop``.

This functionality is making it easier for me to write test suites for Python
projects that involve disk encryption, for example crypto-drive-manager_ and
rsync-system-backup_.

.. _Release 0.2: https://github.com/xolox/python-linux-utils/compare/0.1...0.2

`Release 0.1`_ (2017-06-21)
---------------------------

The initial release of ``linux-utils`` supports parsing of the ``/etc/fstab``
(``/proc/mounts``) and ``/etc/crypttab`` configuration file formats based on a
"generic tabfile" parser. The "history" section of the readme explains why this
project came to be:

----

Back in 2015 I wrote some Python code to parse the Linux configuration files
``/etc/fstab`` and ``/etc/crypttab`` for use in crypto-drive-manager_. Fast
forward to 2017 and I found myself wanting to use the same functionality
in rsync-system-backup_. Three options presented themselves to me:

1. **Copy/paste the relevant code.** Having to maintain the same code in
   multiple places causes lower quality code because having to duplicate the
   effort of writing documentation, developing tests and fixing bugs is a very
   demotivating endeavor. In fact sometime in 2016 I *did* copy/paste parts of
   this code into a project at work, because I needed similar functionality
   there. Of course since then the two implementations diverged :-p.

2. **Make crypto-drive-manager a dependency of rsync-system-backup.** Although
   this approach is less ugly than copy/pasting the code, it still isn't
   exactly elegant because the two projects have nothing to do with each other
   apart from working with LUKS encrypted disks on Linux.

3. **Extract the functionality into a new package.** In my opinion this was
   clearly the most elegant approach, unfortunately it also required the most
   work from me :-). On the plus side I've published linux-utils with a test
   suite which means less untested code remains in crypto-drive-manager_ (which
   doesn't have a test suite at the time of writing).

While extracting the code I shortly considered integrating the functionality
into debuntu-tools_, however the ``/etc/fstab`` and ``/etc/crypttab`` parsing
isn't specific to Debian or Ubuntu at all and debuntu-tools_ has several
dependencies that aren't relevant to Linux configuration file parsing.

Tangentially related: The reason I went with the extremely generic name
`linux-utils` is because I will be adding more *"specific to Linux but not
Debian"* functionality to this package in the very near future :-).
