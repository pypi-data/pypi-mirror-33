File store for environment file sample module
=============================================

This module provides a file store for classical configuration by
environment file pattern into OpenERP provided by the
`server_environment` addon.  Please look at this module for more info
and doc.

Note: you should not install this module 'as is', since it is an
example module, but rather adapt it to your needs, and ensure your
version of the module gets picked up by OpenERP. This can be ensured
by putting the directory where your version of
server_environment_files lives before this one in the addons-path
variable of the OpenERP configuration file.
