# zepid

If you have any requests for items to be included, please contact me and I will work on adding any requested features. You can contact me either through github (https://github.com/pzivich), email (gmail: zepidpy), or twitter (@zepidpy).

zepid is an epidemiology analysis package, providing easy to use tools for epidemiologists coding in python3. The purpose of this package is to provide a toolset to make epidemiology e-z. A variety of calculations and plots can be generated through various functions. For a sample walkthrough of what this package is capable of, please look to the introduction to Python 3 for epidemiologists at https://github.com/pzivich/Python-for-Epidemiologists

Just a few highlights to provide: basic epidemiology calculations, easily create functional form assessment plots, easily create effectmeasure plots, generate and conduct diagnostic tests on inverse probability weight.
