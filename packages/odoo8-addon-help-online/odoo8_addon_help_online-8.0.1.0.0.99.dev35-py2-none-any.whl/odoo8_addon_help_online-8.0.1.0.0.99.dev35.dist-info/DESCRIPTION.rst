Help Online
===========

This module allows the creation of an online help available from the lists
and forms in Odoo.

page for the related model if the page exists and the user is member of the
group 'Help reader'. If the page doesn't exist and the user is member of
the group 'Help writer', the module generate a button allowing the creation an
help page.

The help pages are created and managed via the website Module.

      adapted.
