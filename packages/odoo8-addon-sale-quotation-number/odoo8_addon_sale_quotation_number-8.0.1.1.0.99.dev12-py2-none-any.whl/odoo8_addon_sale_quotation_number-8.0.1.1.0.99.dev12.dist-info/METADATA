This module adds a sale quotation sequence.
===========================================

Defining.

*Sale Quotation:* Sale process in draft stage just informing prices and element
of communication.
*Sale Order:* Sale process confirmed, the customer already have a compromise
with us in terms of pay an invoice and receive our product or service.

Originally OpenERP manage only 1 sequence for this 2 documents, then the sales
order won and lost manage the same sequence losting almost all lost quotations
in terms of sequences, making so difficult understand qith a quick view if we
are good or bad in terms of logistic and sale process already confirmed.

Technical Explanation:

When you create a quotation, it is numbered using the 'sale.quotation'
sequence.  When you confirm a quotation, its orginal number is saved in the
'origin' field and the sale order gets a new number, retrieving it from
'sale.order' sequence.

With Openerp Base.

Sale Quotation 1 Number = SO001
Sale Quotation 2 Number = SO002
Sale Quotation 3 Number = SO003
Sale Quotation 4 Number = SO004
