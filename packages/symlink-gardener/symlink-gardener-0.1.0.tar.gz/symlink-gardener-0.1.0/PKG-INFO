Description: Symlink Gardener
        ================
        
        Symlink Gardener is a symlink farm manager akin to GNU Stow, but with
        additional features that are useful for tasks such as managing dotfiles.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Options for conflict resolution.  By default, packages will silently
          shadow symlinks from packages with lower precedence than them, but
          actions will fail when there are conflicts with "weeds" (files not
          owned by the garden).  However, different conflict resolution
          strategies can also be specified.
        - A more tangible concept of packages than stow.  Packages can have
          their own config files to declare files to ignore (and maybe more
          stuff in the future), and packages have a real concept of being
          installed which allows symlinks to be easily and accurately updated
          when packages change.
        - A command for easily moving a weed into a package and symlinking it
          back out.
        - And most importantly -- hastily tacked on gardening metaphors!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Python >= 3.6 is required.
        
        Recommended installation (with `pipsi`_):
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ pipsi install --python=python3 symlink-gardener
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        Create a garden in the current directory
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener prepare
        
        Plant (install) packages in the garden
        
        This creates symlinks in the garden directory at paths that correspond
        to those in the package directory.
        
        Packages may be customized in ``/.garden-package.json`` (currently all
        you can do is add ignore patterns)
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener plant path/to/common path/to/ex other-ex:path/to/other/ex
        
        Update symlinks for all installed packages
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener tend
        
        Add weeds to an installed package.
        
        This moves the specified files from the garden directory to the package
        and creates a symlink in their place.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener cultivate -p common some/file another/file
        
        Prune (uninstall) packages
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener prune ex other-ex
        
        See the help for more
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            $ gardener help
