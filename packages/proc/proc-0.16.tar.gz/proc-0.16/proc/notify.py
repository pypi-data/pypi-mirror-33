"""
The :mod:`proc.notify` module implements a headless notify-send_ program.

The notify-send program can be used to send desktop notifications to the user
from the command line. It's great for use in otherwise non-interactive programs
to unobtrusively inform the user about something, for example I use it to show
a notification when a system backup is starting and when it has completed.

One problem is that notify-send needs access to a few environment variables
from the desktop session in order to deliver its message. The values of these
environment variables change every time a desktop session is started. This
complicates the use of notify-send from e.g. system daemons and `cron jobs`_
(say for an automated backup solution :-).

This module builds on top of the :mod:`proc.core` module as a trivial (but
already useful :-) example of how the `proc` package can be used to search
through the environments of all available processes. It looks for the variables
in :attr:`REQUIRED_VARIABLES` in the environments of all available processes
and uses the values it finds to run the notify-send program. It's available on
the command line as ``notify-send-headless`` (which accepts the same arguments
as ``notify-send``). Given super-user privileges this should work fine out of
the box on any Linux system.
