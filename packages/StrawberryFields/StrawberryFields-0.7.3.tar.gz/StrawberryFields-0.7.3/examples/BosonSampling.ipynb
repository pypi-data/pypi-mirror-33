    "Introduced by [Aaronson and Arkhipov](https://doi.org/10.4086/toc.2013.v009a004), boson sampling presented a slight deviation from the general approach in quantum computation. Rather than presenting a theoretical model of universal quantum computation (i.e. a framework that enables quantum simulation of any arbitrary Hamiltonian), boson sampling-based devices are instead an example of an **intermediate quantum computer**, designed to experimentally implement a computation that is classically computationally hard.\n",

    "Boson sampling proposes the following [quantum linear optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_optical_quantum_computing) scheme. An array of single photon sources are set up, designed to simultaneously emit single photon states into a multimode linear [interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry); the results are then generated by sampling from the probability of single photon measurements from the output of the linear interferometer.\n",
