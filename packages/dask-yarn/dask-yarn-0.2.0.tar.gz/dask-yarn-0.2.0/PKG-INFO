        Dask-Yarn deploys Dask on `YARN
        <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html>`_
        clusters, as are found in traditional Hadoop installations. Dask-Yarn provides
        an easy interface to quickly start, stop, and scale Dask clusters natively from
        Python.
        
        See `the documentation <https://dask-yarn.readthedocs.org>`_ for more
