=================

This is an external policy checker for the postfix mail server.  It will use
pyspf to check SPF records to determine if email should be rejected or
deferred by your server.

To install from the tar.gz (if this software has been packaged for your
distribution, the packaged version is recommended and should be installed
using your normal distribution packaging tools):

1.  Extract the package from the tarball (tar -xvvzf ...)
2.  Enter the package directory (cd ...)
3.  As root:
python3 setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record=/dev/null

It requires Python3 (python3.3+) - as of version 2.0.0, python2 is no longer
supported, the pyspf (python-spf) library version 2.0.9 or higher, and authres.  

Nothing is configured by default, so this will not interact with Postfix until
it has been set up.

See man 1 policyd-spf for information on setting up and using this policy
server.

See man 5 policyd-spf.conf for configuration file information.
