class SimPipeRunner(MethodDecorator):
    '''
    Class decorator annotating simulation pipeline runners with custom metadata.

    All such runners decorated by the :func:`piperunner` decorator are
    guaranteed to be instances of this class, which provides all metadata passed
    to this decorator as instance variables of the same name.

    Attributes
    ----------
    categories : SequenceTypes
        Sequence of one or more human-readable strings iteratively naming all
        arbitrary categories to which this runner belongs (in descending order
        of hierarchical taxonomy).
    method_name : str
        Name of the method implementing this runner.
    requirements : SetType
        Set of zero or more :class:`SimPipeRunnerRequirement` instances
        specifying all simulation features required by this runner.
    description : str
        Human-readable description of this runner as a **single-line string**
        (i.e., containing no newlines).

    '''
    Decorator annotating simulation pipeline **runners** (i.e., methods of
    :class:`SimPipeABC` subclasses with names prefixed by
    :attr:`SimPipeABC._RUNNER_METHOD_NAME_PREFIX`) with custom metadata.

    All methods decorated by this decorator are guaranteed to be instances of
    the :class:`SimPipeRunner` class, which provides all metadata passed to
    this decorator as instance variables of the same name.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This decorator is strictly optional.** Runners *not* decorated by this
    decorator are still runnable from simulation pipelines. Since this decorator
    annotates runners with metadata, however, unannotated runners will *not* be
    usable by external interfaces expecting this metadata -- typically, GUIs
    populating interactive widget fields by this metadata.

    **Runner methods decorated by this decorator should not be decorated by
    other decorators.** In particular, decorated methods should *not* also be
    decorated by :func:`@type_check`, which this decorator already internally
    decorates all decorated methods by.

    Parameters
    ----------
    categories : SequenceTypes
        Sequence of one or more human-readable strings iteratively naming all
        arbitrary categories to which this runner belongs (in descending order
        of hierarchical taxonomy). Categories are arbitrary labels accessed
        *only* by external interfaces and are otherwise ignored by the core
        codebase. Specifically:
        * The first string in this sequence names an arbitrary **root category**
          (e.g., root node in a tree view), intended to be shared between
          multiple runners. This string is typically a broadly applicable label
          such as ``Voltage Plots``.
        * The last string in this sequence names an arbitrary **leaf category**
          (e.g., leaf node in a tree view), intended to be unique to a single
          runner. This string is typically a narrowly applicable label such as
          ``Extracellular Voltage Plot``.
        * All other strings in this sequence name arbitrary categories of
          increasingly fine-grained depth, again intended to be shared between
          multiple runners.
    requirements : optional[SetType]
        Set of zero or more :class:`SimPipeRunnerRequirement` instances
        specifying all simulation features required by this runner. This
        decorator then decorates this runner by performing the following logic
        immediately *before* calling this runner:
        * For each requirement in this set...
          * If this requirement is unsatisfied by the current simulation phase
            (e.g., as the configuration for this phase disables extracellular
            spaces), this requirement (and hence this runner) is unsatisfied.
            Since this constitutes a fatal error, an
            :class:`BetseSimPipeRunnerUnsatisfiedException` is raised.
          * Else, this runner is run.
        Defaults to ``None``, in which case no such decoration is applied.
