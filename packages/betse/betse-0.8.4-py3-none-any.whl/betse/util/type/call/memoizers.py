#FIXME: Rename to "function_cached". While this decorator *COULD* technically be
#used to decorate non-function callables, it never will be. Why? Because:
#
#* Decorating lambdas is highly non-trivial and hence impractical.
#* Attempting to cache unbound method return values via this decorator would do
#  so globally rather than on an instance-specific basis and hence be
#  functionally useless. To instead cache bound method return values on an
#  instance-specific basis, this decorator would need to be refactored to return
#  a descriptor whose __get__() special method created and returned bound
#  methods whose return values are cached onto instance variables of those bound
#  methods themselves. For similar functionality, see the @expr_alias data
#  descriptor.

def callable_cached(func: CallableTypes) -> CallableTypes:
    '''
    Decorate the passed **non-property callable** (e.g., function, lambda,
    method) to cache the value returned by the first call of this callable.

    On the first call of a callable decorated with this decorator, the passed
    callable is called with all passed parameters, the value returned by this
    callable is cached into a private attribute of this callable, and this value
    is returned. On each subsequent call of this callable, the cached value is
    returned as is *without* calling this callable. Hence, this callable is
    called at most once for each instance of the class containing this property.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This decorator does not memoize callables.** Memoization would map each
    permutation of parameters passed to the decorated callable to a unique
    return value conditionally cached (and hence returned) for that permutation.

    This decorator instead unconditionally caches (and hence returns) a single
    return value for *all* permutations of passed parameters. Hence, this
    decorator is principally intended to decorate callables accepting *no*
    parameters (e.g., simple testers and getters).

def property_cached(property_method: CallableTypes) -> PropertyType:
    '''
    Decorate the passed property method to cache the value returned by the first
    implicit call of this method.

    On the first access of a property decorated with this decorator, the passed
    method implementing this property is called, the value returned by this
    property is internally cached into a private attribute of the object to
    which this method is bound, and this value is returned. On each subsequent
    access of this property, this cached value is returned as is _without_
    calling this method. Hence, this method is called at most once for each
    object exposing this property.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This decorator does not destroy bound property methods.** Technically, the
    most efficient means of caching a property value into an instance is to
    replace the property method currently bound to that instance with an
    instance variable initialized to that value (e.g., as documented by this
    `StackOverflow answer`_).

    Since a property should only ever be treated as an instance variable,
    there superficially exists little harm in dynamically changing the type of
    the former to the latter. Sadly, doing so introduces numerous subtle issues
    with no plausible workaround.

    In particular, replacing property methods by instance variables prevents
    pickling logic elsewhere from automatically excluding cached property
    values, forcing these values to *always* be pickled to disk. This is bad.
    Cached property values are *always* safely recreatable in memory (and hence
    need *not* be pickled) and typically space-consumptive in memory (and hence
    best *not* pickled). The slight efficiency gain from replacing property
    methods by instance variables is hardly worth the significant space loss
    from pickling these variables.
