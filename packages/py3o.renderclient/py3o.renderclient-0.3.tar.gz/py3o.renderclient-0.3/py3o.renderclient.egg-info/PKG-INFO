Description: Overview
        ========
        
        py3o.renderclient is a client library that can be used to easily integrate with
        the py3o.renderserver to transform LibreOffice/OpenOffice documents into PDF.
        
        http://bitbucket.org/faide/py3o.renderserver
        
        This architecture was designed to avoid the pyuno dependency in the client program.
        Depending on pyuno is really complicated on some plateforms.
        
        Using this client you can leverage a distant (or local) renderserver to transform
        documents for you with nearly no code.
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Here is a sample minimalistic client that considers you have a renderserver running
        on localhost::
        
            from py3o.renderclient import RenderClient
        
            client = RenderClient('localhost', 8994)
            client.login('toto', 'plouf')
            client.render('py3o_example.odt', 'py3o_example.pdf', 'pdf')
        
        For the moment the login/password phase is not checked by the server, but we aim to
        add an authentication layer in the future.
        
        Status
        ======
        
        Since we are still in pre 1.0 releases we may change the API and add more functionnalities,
        now is a good time to give feed-back and feature requests.
