In this dialog project database pararameters are displayed. When they have been 
changed and OK button is clicked, the Application builder will check connection 
to the database and if it failed to connect an error will be displayed.

.. note::
   When any **Database** parameter is changed, except **DB manual update**, 
   the server application must be restarted for changes to take effect.

If **DB manual update** checkbox is unchecked (default), then when changes to an 
item, that have an associated database table, are saved, this database table is 
automatically modified. For example, if we add a new field to some item in the
:doc:`Item Editor Dialog </admin/items/item_editor_dialog>`
, the new field will be added to the associated database table. If this checkbox 
is checked, no modifications to the database tables are made. 

.. note::
    Please be very carefull when using this option.
