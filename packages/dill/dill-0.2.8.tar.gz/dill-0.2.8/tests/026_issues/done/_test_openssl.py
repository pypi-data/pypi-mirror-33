# NOTE: Is this still an issue?
#       If so, can you post some code that reproduces the error?
#       Can you produce a PicklingError of the object in question from `dill`?
#       An error of this type common when __name__ != __qualname__
#       I'd either post an issue with `dill` or `OpenSSL`, probably the latter
