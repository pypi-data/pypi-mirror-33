termination conditions use the nested function factory pattern, and could easily be converted to classes. Several functions exist (like state) that must extract "state" from the terminations conditions, and rely on a trick of parsing dynamically generated documentation. Instead of standing on my head to extract state, it'd be easy if the termination conditions were classes.
