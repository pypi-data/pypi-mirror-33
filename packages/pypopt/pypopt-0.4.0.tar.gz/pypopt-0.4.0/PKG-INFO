Description: Pypopt: Ipopt for Python
        ========================
        
        Pypopt is an Ipopt wrapper for Python. The aim is to expose the same
        API as Ipopt C++ interface.
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        TODO
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
         * A working C++ compiler
         * Cython
         * Ipopt
         * Pytest + pytest-runner + pytest-cov for testing
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install `pypopt` simply run::
        
        	python setup.py install
        
        
        If you have Ipopt installed in a different location than ``/usr``::
        
        	IPOPT_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/ipopt/include IPOPT_LIBRARY_DIR=/path/to/ipopt/lib python setup.py install
