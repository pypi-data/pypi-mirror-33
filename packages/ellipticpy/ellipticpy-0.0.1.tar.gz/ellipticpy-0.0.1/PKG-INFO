Description: # Elliptic-py
        
        Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in pure Python implementation. This is a port to elliptic js in python. However, it has the ability to do more than what elliptic js does.
        
        NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
        for your cryptography operations.
        
        ## Incentive
        
        ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the pythonic implementations are
        even slower.
        
        ## API
        
        You can read the docs [here](https://justdvnsh.github.io/elliptic-py)
        
        ## Supported curves
        
        Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:
        
        * `secp256k1`
        * `p192`
        * `p224`
        * `p256`
        * `p384`
        * `p521`
        
        ## Acknowledgements
        
        This project is heavily inspired by the javascript implementation of elliptic . you can find it [here](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic). Also, the naming conventions and references have also been taken from [here](https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa). The ellitpic curve details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography).
