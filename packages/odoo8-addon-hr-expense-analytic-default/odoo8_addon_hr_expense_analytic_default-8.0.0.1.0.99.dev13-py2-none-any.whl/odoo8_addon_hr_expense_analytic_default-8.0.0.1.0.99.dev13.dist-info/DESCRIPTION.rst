Default Analytic on Expenses
===========================

This module adds 2 fields:

* *Default Analytic Account* on the employee form (*HR Settings* tab),

* *Default Analytic Account* on the expense form.

If you set a Default Analytic Account on the employee, it will be copied
to the Default Analytic Account of the expenses of this employee. The
Default Analytic Account of the expense is used by default on each
expense line.
