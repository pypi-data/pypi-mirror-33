### So why would I want to use this?

Say you wanted to know how many Archean-aged samples have been submitted to IEDA by your colleague named Dr S Barnes:

```python
>>> import earthchem
>>> q = earthchem.Query(
        author='barnes',
        geologicalage='archean'
    )
>>> q.count()
```
```
876
```

Nice, let's take a look at the compositions of these

```python
>>> df = q.dataframe()
>>> df.head()
```
```

```

Hmm looks like Dr Barnes is a bit of a komatiite expert

```python
>>> fig = df.mgo.hist()
>>> fig.set_xlabel('MgO (wt %)')
>>> fig.set_ylabel('Sample count')
```

Maybe we'd like to see this as a ternary plot instead...

```python
>>> earthchem.plot.ternaryplot(df, components=['mgo', 'al2o3', 'cao'])
```

If spiderplots are more your thing we have you covered too (although we have to make up some data for this one...): 

```python
>>> reels = ec.geochem.REE(output='string')
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({k: v for k,v in zip(reels, np.random.rand(len(reels), 2))})
>>> ec.plot.spiderplot(df)
```

### Great, I'm sold. How do I get it?

Provided you have python installed, this library is just a `pip install earthchem` away. 

If you don't have Python we recommend taking a look at the marvellous [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/) - just pick your relevant platform download [from here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
