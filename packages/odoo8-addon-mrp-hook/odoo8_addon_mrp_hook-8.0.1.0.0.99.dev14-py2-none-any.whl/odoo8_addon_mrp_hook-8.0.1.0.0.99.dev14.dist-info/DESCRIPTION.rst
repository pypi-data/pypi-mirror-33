===============================
Hooks for enabling advanced MRP
===============================

Technical module that provides the proper framework infrastructure (hooks,
fallback, etc) to enable advanced functionality in the manufacturing area,
as https://github.com/odoo/odoo/pull/8885 hasn't been accepted for v8:

* Hooks in *_bom_explode* method to return a dictionary for consumption and
  workcenter lines.
* Provide product and template on *_bom_find*.

Usage
=====

By itself it doesn't provide anything visible, but serves as base for others
modules to develop its features.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module fully overwrites _bom_explode method, so any other module
  inheriting this method should take this into account.
* On v9, this module can be removed, as the hooks have been integrated.
