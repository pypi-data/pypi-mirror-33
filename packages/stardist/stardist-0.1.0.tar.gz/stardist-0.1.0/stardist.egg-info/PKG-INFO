        ## Installation
        
        This package requires Python 3 and can be installed with `pip`:
        
            pip install stardist
        
        ### Notes
        - Depending on your Python installation, you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
        - Since this package relies on a C++ extension, you may run into compilation problems on some platforms. We currently do not provide pre-compiled binaries.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        We provide several Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/mpicbg-csbd/stardist/tree/master/examples) that illustrate how this package can be used.
