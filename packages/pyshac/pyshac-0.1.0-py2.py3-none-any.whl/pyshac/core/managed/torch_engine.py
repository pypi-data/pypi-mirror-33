class TorchSHAC(optimizer._SHAC):
    """
    SHAC Engine specifically built for PyTorch when using CPUs/GPUs.

    This engine is used primarily for its management of how many evaluation processes
    are used, and to provide a unified interface similar to TensorflowSHAC in determining
    the number of GPUs and CPU cores used.

    Since PyTorch allocates memory to the graph dynamically, graph maintanence is
    unnecessary. As long as the system has enough memory to run multiple copies of
    the evaluation model, there is no additional work required by the user inside the
    evaluation function.

    # Arguments:
        evaluation_function ((int, list) -> float): The evaluation function is
            passed the integer id (of the worker) and the sampled hyper parameters
            in an OrderedDict. The evaluation function is expected to pass a python
            floating point number representing the evaluated value.
        hyperparameter_list (hp.HyperParameterList | None): A list of parameters
            (or a HyperParameterList) that are passed to define the search space.
            Can be None, so that it is loaded from disk instead.
        total_budget (int): `N`. Defines the total number of models to evaluate.
        num_batches (int): `M`. Defines the number of batches the work is distributed
            to. Must be set such that `total budget` is divisible by `batch size`.
        max_gpu_evaluators (int): number of gpus. Can be 0 or more. Decides the number of
            GPUs used to evaluate models in parallel.
        objective (str): Can be `max` or `min`. Whether to maximise the evaluation
            measure or minimize it.
        max_classifiers (int): Maximum number of classifiers that
            are trained. Default (18) is according to the paper.
        max_cpu_evaluators (int): Positive integer > 0 or -1. Sets the number
            of parallel evaluation functions calls are executed simultaneously.
            Set this to 1 unless you have a lot of memory for 2 or more models
            to be trained simultaneously. If set to -1, uses all CPU cores to
            evaluate N models simultaneously. Will cause OOM if the models are
            large.
