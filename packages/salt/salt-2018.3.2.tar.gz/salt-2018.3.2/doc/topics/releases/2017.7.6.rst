In Progress: Salt 2017.7.6 Release Notes
===========================

Version 2017.7.6 is an **unreleased** bugfix release for :ref:`2017.7.0 <release-2017-7-0>`.
This release is still in progress and has not been released yet.

Tornado 5.0 Support for Python 2 Only
-------------------------------------

Tornado 5.0 moves to using asyncio for all python3 versions.  Because of this
and changes in asyncio between python 3.4 and 3.5 to only be able to use one
ioloop, which requires some rearchitecting, support for tornado 5.0 and python3
versions of salt has been delayed to a later release.

For now, to use tornado 5.0, the python 2 version of salt must be used.

Option to Return to Previous Pillar Include Behavior
----------------------------------------------------

Prior to version 2017.7.3, keys from :ref:`pillar includes <pillar-include>`
would be merged on top of the pillar SLS. Since 2017.7.3, the includes are
merged together and then the pillar SLS is merged on top of that.

The :conf_master:`pillar_includes_override_sls` option has been added allow
users to switch back to the pre-2017.7.3 behavior.
