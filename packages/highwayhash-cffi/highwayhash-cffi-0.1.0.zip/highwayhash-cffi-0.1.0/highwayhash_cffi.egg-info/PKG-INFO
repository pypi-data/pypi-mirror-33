Description: highwayhash-cffi
        ================
        
        `HighwayHash <https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06257>`__ is a pseudorandom
        function (i.e.Â keyed hash function) optimized for speed on short
        messages, designed by Jyrki Alakuijala, Bill Cox and Jan Wassenberg of
        Google research.
        
        This package provides tested, performant **Python 3** CFFI bindings to
        the `HighwayHash reference
        implementation <https://github.com/google/highwayhash>`__, including
        support for all output lengths.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        You can install this package using ``pip`` or the included ``setup.py``
        script:
        
        ::
        
           # Using pip
           pip install highwayhash-cffi
        
           # Using setup.py
           python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from highwayhash import *
        
           # Demonstration key and data
           key = b"\0" * 32
           data = b"\0" * 64
        
           # HighwayHash with a 64-bit output length
           output = highwayhash_64(key, data)
        
           # HighwayHash with a 128-bit output length
           output = highwayhash_128(key, data)
        
           # HighwayHash with a 256-bit output length
           output = highwayhash_256(key, data)
