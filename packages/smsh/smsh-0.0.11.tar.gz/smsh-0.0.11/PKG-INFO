Description: # smsh
        A command line utility enabling SSH-like interactive sessions and continuous output for long running commands via the AWS SSM API.
        The tool provides continuous output from the SendCommand operation, despite the output not being available via the AWS API.
        
        ## installing
        Currently, `smsh` is only distributed as source. Clone this repository and then bulid it with setuptools:
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## interactive usage
        `smsh` allows you to enter an interactive shell session by just providing the instance-id or IP address:
        
        ```
        smsh i-123450asdf12345
        ```
        
        Once "connected", the user is then given an input prompt, similar to a shell prompt:
        
        ```
        [root@demo-instance root]#
        ```
        
        The instance name will get set to the "Name" tag of the instance, or will default to the instance-id if no Name is set.
        The user can then interact with the session like it was a remote shell:
        
        ```
        [root@demo-instance root]# ls -al
        total 40
        dr-xr-x---  3 root root 4096 Mar 15 21:47 .
        dr-xr-xr-x 25 root root 4096 Mar 15 18:44 ..
        -rw-r--r--  1 root root   18 Jan 15  2011 .bash_logout
        -rw-r--r--  1 root root  176 Jan 15  2011 .bash_profile
        -rw-r--r--  1 root root  176 Jan 15  2011 .bashrc
        -rw-r--r--  1 root root  100 Jan 15  2011 .cshrc
        drwx------  2 root root 4096 Mar 14 21:53 .ssh
        -rw-r--r--  1 root root  129 Jan 15  2011 .tcshrc
        [root@demo-instance root]#
        ```
        
        ## ephemeral usage
        `smsh` also allows for single remote commands to be executed. This can be run by providing the `-c` flag:
        
        ```
        smsh i-123450asdf12345 -c 'ls -al'
        ```
        
        The output will be printed directly to the console.
        
        ## output
        This tool supports unbuffered output mode (still technically buffered), where users can get constant real time
        output for long-running commands, despite the output not being available via the AWS API.
        This is a large limitation of SSM. By default, all `smsh` output is unbuffered. This
        can lead to performance issues though, as the client will be constantly polling the instance for the latest output.
        
        Clients can run in buffered mode by adding the argument, `--buffered-output`.
        
        Because there is near real-time output, long running commands become much more usable. Additionally, things like `tail -f`
        are natively supported.
        
        ```
        [root@demo-instance root]# tail -f my.log
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:02 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:03 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:04 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:05 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:06 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:07 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:08 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:09 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:10 UTC 2018!!!!
        long running process Thu Mar 15 21:51:11 UTC 2018!!!!
        
        ```
        
        ## state
        In interactive mode, the session state is maintained throughout the session. This includes the current working directory, the current environment
        variables (both local and exported), and the current user.
        
        ```
        root@demo-instance root]# pwd
        /root
        [root@demo-instance root]# cd /var/log
        [root@demo-instance log]# pwd
        /var/log
        [root@demo-instance log]#
        ```
        
        ## canceling a command
        In interactive mode, CTRL+C will cancel any command with the SSM API, and as such SIGTERM should be sent to the executing command
        on the target managed instance. Additionally, sending a SIGTERM to `smsh` in either interactive or ephemeral mode should likewise result
        in the SIGTERM being sent to the instance.
        
        ## editor
        This tool also allows for local Vi/Nano editors to be used. Just like when normally using them on a remote machine,
        they can open up existing or new files. However, because of the nature of the program, any new files that are opened
        in an editor and saved without any content are discarded.
        
        ```
        [root@demo-instance log]# vi somefile.txt
        ```
        
        
        ## considerations
        The following are some considerations for using this tool:
        
        * This tool polls. If there are many users in an account,
          or if there are many commands being executed, API calls
          could be throttled. This tool attempts to do exponential backoff
          to try to avoid this situation.
        * DescribeCommandInvocation does not support tag based permissions. So,
          while you can control the SendCommand based on tag,
          anyone will effectively be able to see the output of every command.
        * SSM limits the script size that can be sent via the SendCommand
          action. This size limit can impact the Editor usage, when editing
          very large files.
        * Output buffering. Even the unbuffered mode buffers up to 100 lines at a time.
          If the output is happening faster than that, the command can get backed up.
