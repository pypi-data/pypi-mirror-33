        ======
        
        The Simple Python Tomato (Pomodoro) timer.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code::
        
          $ python -m pip install --user pymato
          $ pymato pom doing something cool
          Task - doing something cool
          0:24:59
        
        When the timer runs out it will emit a visual bell, so your terminal should
        blink or notify you of activity. Want to see what you've been working on?
        
        .. code::
        
          $ pymato log
          2018-02-28
                      25m writing pymato documentation
                      25m doing something cool
          -----------------------------------------
                      50m total pomodoro time
        
        
        Right now that's pretty much all it does. It saves your logs to ``pymato.log``
        in the current folder. You can delete or edit entries that way. If you start a
        task and you get called away in the middle of your pom, you can just hit
        ctrl+c. Then it will ask if you'd like to save that pom.
        
        .. code::
        
          $ pymato pom a task that will get interrupted
          Task - a task that will get interrupted
          ^C0:23:59Aborted - save to log anyway?
          y/[n]: y
          $ pymato log
          2018-02-28
                      25m writing pymato documentation
                      25m doing something cool
                       7m doing something cool
          -----------------------------------------
                      57m total pomodoro time
        
        
        Future Goals
        ------------
        
        I'd like to have ``pymato sum`` that would give you a summary - probably with
        the option to group by either task or day. Might be nice to see some kinds of
        ascii graphs or something too. I'd also be down with the ability to add notes
        to entries if you need to keep a record of things you've done. Or the ability
        to link work to your git/hg/svn commit history.
