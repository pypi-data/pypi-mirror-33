Description: 
        # Python-solaredge
        
        Python-solaredge (*pysolaredge* for short) is a library for decrypting and
        decoding messages from a SolarEdge photo-voltaic installation (solar panels,
        optimizers and inverters, mainly). Such an installation normally reports its
        statistics to a server operated by SolarEdge.  This libray allows you to decode
        the data yourself, and use it how you see fit.
