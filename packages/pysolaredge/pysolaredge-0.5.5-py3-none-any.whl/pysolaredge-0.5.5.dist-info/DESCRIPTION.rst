# Python-solaredge

Python-solaredge (*pysolaredge* for short) is a library for decrypting and
decoding messages from a SolarEdge photo-voltaic installation (solar panels,
optimizers and inverters, mainly). Such an installation normally reports its
statistics to a server operated by SolarEdge.  This libray allows you to decode
the data yourself, and use it how you see fit.
