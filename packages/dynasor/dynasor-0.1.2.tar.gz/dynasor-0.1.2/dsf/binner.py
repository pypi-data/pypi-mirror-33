    Class for averaging data sets of points (x,y) with a priori decided
    positions (x), over a pre-defined number of equally sized, linearely
    distriuted bins.

    This is used to get an average of y for a set of lineary spaced x values
    when a possibly large set of {y(x)} is given.

    The result will be an array containing, for each bin, the average y-value
    over the data points having its x-value within the respective bin x-range.
