Account Payment Sale
====================

This module should be used when the invoice is based on the sale order.

This modules adds one field on sale orders: *Payment Mode*.
This field is copied from partner to sale order and then from sale order to
customer invoice.

This module is similar to the *sale_payment* module; the main difference is
that it doesn't depend on the *account_payment_extension* module (it's not the
only module to conflict with *account_payment_extension*; all the SEPA
modules in the banking addons conflict with *account_payment_extension*.

Installation
============

This module depends on :
* purchase
* account_payment_partner

This module is part of the OCA/bank-payment suite.

Configuration
=============

There is nothing to configure.

Usage
=====

You are able to add a payment mode directly on a partner.
This payment mode is automatically associated to the sale order, then on related invoice. 
This default value could be change in a draft sale order or draft invoice.
When you create an direct debit order, only invoices related to chosen payment mode are displayed.
Invoices without any payment mode are displayed to.
