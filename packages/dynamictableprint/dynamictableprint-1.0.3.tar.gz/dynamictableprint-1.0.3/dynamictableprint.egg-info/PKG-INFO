Description: ## About
        This python3 module aims to add additional functionality to the already amazing
        TablePrint (github.com/nirum/tableprint).
        
        While TablePrint is functionally excellent at printing out text to
        the console in a beautiful manner, I have found that it lacks some dynamicism.
        When printing to a console that is constantly different sizes for example,
        wrapping the text around produces basically illegible tables.
        
        This module aims to improve the situation where the user is doing data heavy
        string representation, using data processing packages such as Pandas (which,
        this module only supports, and also, _thank you_ to nirum for adding in Pandas
        DataFrame support). Based on the size of the console, and some priorities to
        each column given by the user, we will squish columns as needed until it fits
        nicely within the given constraints. When the console width changes, the
        program will need to be reloaded, but will adjust to fit the new screen.
        
        ## Installation
        You'll have to clone directly from github into your source repo for now.
        Looking into improving this!
        
        ## Usage
        ```py
        from dynamictableprint import DynamicTablePrint
        import pandas as pd
        
        d = {
            'names': [
                "Albert Einstein",
                "Issac Newton",
                "Stephen Hawkings"
            ],
            'places': [
                "Ulm, Germany",
                "Wolsthorpe Manor, United Kingdom",
                "Oxford, United Kingdom"
            ],
            'Foods': [
                "Spaghetti",
                "Pasta",
                "Noodles"
            ]
        }
        data_frame = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
        
        dtp = DynamicTablePrint(data_frame, angel_column='Foods', squish_column='places')
        dtp.banner('Things!')
        dtp.
        dtp.write_to_screen()
        ```
        
        The `squish_column` represents the column that you would like to be squished
        first. Typically the 'squish factor' is 20% at most, but will dynamically vary
        depending on how the other columns are. The `angel_column` is the column that
        you would prefer to be modified last, that is, having the highest priority on
        being the same.
