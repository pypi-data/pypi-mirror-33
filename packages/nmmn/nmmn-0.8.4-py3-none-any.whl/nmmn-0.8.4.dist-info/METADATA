Description: `nmmn` package
        ================
        
        Tools for astronomy, data analysis, time series, numerical simulations, gamma-ray astronomy and more! These are modules I wrote which I find useful—for whatever reason—in my research.
        
        List of submodules available ([more info here](http://rsnemmen.github.io/nmmn/)):
        
        * `astro`: astronomy
        * `dsp`: signal processing
        * `lsd`: misc. operations on arrays, lists, dictionaries and sets
        * `stats`: statistical methods
        * `sed`: spectral energy distributions
        * `plots`: custom plots
        * `fermi`: Fermi LAT analysis methods
        * `bayes`: Bayesian tools for dealing with posterior distributions
        * `grmhd`: tools for dealing with GRMHD numerical simulations
        
        Very basic [documentation](http://rsnemmen.github.io/nmmn/) for the modules.
        
        # Installation
        
        You have a couple of options to install the module:
        
        1. Install using `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install nmmn
        ```
        
        
        2. Install the module on the system’s python library path: 
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        3. Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available:
        
        ```
        python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        This last method is preferred to sync with changes in the repo. You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.
        
        To upgrade the package to the latest stable version, try
        
            pip install --upgrade nmmn
        
        if you installed with `pip`. If you installed with the `setup.py` script and the `develop` option, try
        
            cd /path/to/nmmn
            git pull
        
        # Usage
        
        Example 1: Remove all `nan` and `inf` elements from a `numpy` array.
        
        ```python
        import nmmn.lsd, numpy
        x=numpy.array([1,2,numpy.nan,numpy.inf])
        xok=nmmn.lsd.delweird(x)
        ```
        
        Example 2: Reads SED generated by [`grmonty`](https://github.com/rsnemmen/grmonty).
        
        ```python
        import nmmn.sed
        s=nmmn.sed.SED()
        s.grmonty('grmonty.spec')
        plot(s.lognu, s.ll)
        ```
        
        Now it is easy to compute the bolometric luminosity: `s.bol()`.
        
        
        TBD
        
        # TODO
        
        * [ ] need more examples of how to use the modules
        * [ ] add IFU data cubes method
