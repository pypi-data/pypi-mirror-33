Acknowledging fcmaker
=====================

1) Only use lower case letters when mentioning fcmaker, and always include the version number.
   Ideally, you should also include the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) associated with any 
   of the Github releases, e.g.:
   
   fcmaker |version|: |DOI_latest|
   
-----
   
2) If you use fcmaker for your observations (and remember that you did so by the time you
   reach the publication stage!), please cite:
   
    Vogt, *fcmaker: automating the creation of ESO-compliant finding charts for Observing 
    Blocks on p2*, Astronomy & Computing, 2018, submitted.
   
   In fact, a friendly nudge along the following blurb will give due credits to all those
   that made fcmaker possible in the first place::
   
    This research has made use of \textsc{fcmaker} (Vogt, 2018), a \textsc{python} module 
    to create ESO-compliant finding charts. \textsc{fcmaker} relies on \textsc{matplotlib} 
    (Hunter 2007), \textsc{astropy}, a community-developed core \textsc{python} package 
    for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2013), \textsc{astroplan} (Morris et al. 
    2018), \textsc{aplpy}, an open-source plotting package for \textsc{python} (Robitaille 2012), 
    and \textsc{montage}, funded by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 
    ACI-1440620 and previously funded by the National Aeronautics and Space 
    Administrationâ€™s Earth Science Technology Office, Computation Technologies Project, 
    under Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626 between NASA and the California Institute 
    of Technology. \textsc{fcmaker} uses the VizieR catalogue access tool, CDS, Strasbourg, 
    France. The original description of the VizieR service was published in Ochsenbein (2000). 
    \textsc{fcmaker} also makes use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission 
    Gaia (\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}), processed by the Gaia Data Processing 
    and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, 
    \url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium}). Funding for the DPAC has been 
    provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the 
    Gaia Multilateral Agreement. In particular, \textsc{fcmaker} uses data from the Gaia 
    (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016) Data Release 2 (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2018).
