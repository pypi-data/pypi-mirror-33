Python client library for OctoPrint REST API

This is continued work after the great start by Miro Hrončok of covering the
OctoPrint REST API. Nearly all current functionality in the API has been covered,
but as of yet I have not had time to add extensive testing. (Will do...)

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the package is via ``pip``::

    $ pip install octorest

Usage
-----

TODO: Write basic guide on basic usage

Examples
