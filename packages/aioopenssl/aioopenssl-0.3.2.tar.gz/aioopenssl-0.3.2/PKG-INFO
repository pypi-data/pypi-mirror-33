Description: OpenSSL Transport for asyncio
        #############################
        
        ``aioopenssl`` provides a `asyncio
        <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ Transport which uses
        `PyOpenSSL <https://pyopenssl.readthedocs.org/>`_ instead of the built-in ssl
        module.
        
        The transport has two main advantages compared to the original:
        
        * The TLS handshake can be deferred by passing ``use_starttls=True`` and later
          calling the ``starttls()`` coroutine method.
        
          This is useful for protocols with a `STARTTLS
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS>`_ feature.
        
        * A coroutine can be called during the TLS handshake; this can be used to defer
          the certificate check to a later point, allowing e.g. to get user feedback
          before the ``starttls()`` method returns.
        
          This allows to ask users for certificate trust without the application layer
          protocol interfering or starting to communicate with the unverified peer.
        
        .. note::
        
           Use this module at your own risk. It has currently 0 (in words: zero) test
           coverage; it has been exported from aioxmpp on request, where it undergoes
           implicit testing. If you find bugs, please report them. If possible, add
           regression tests while youâ€™re at it.
        
           If you find security-critical bugs, please follow the procedure announced in
           the `aioxmpp readme <https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp>`_.`
