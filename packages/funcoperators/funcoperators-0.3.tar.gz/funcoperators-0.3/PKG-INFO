Summary: Allow infix function notation like (1,2) /dot/ (3,4) for dot((1,2), (3,4) or 1 /frac/ 3 for frac(1,3) and other useful operators to functions.

Description: Always wanted to add custom operators ?
            a = (1,2,3) /dot/ (4,5,6) # a = 32
        
        Works for existing functions, like `numpy.dot`
        
            import numpy
            dot = infix(numpy.dot)
            a = (1,2,3) /dot/ (4,5,6) # use as an infix
            a = dot((1,2,3), (4,5,6)) # still works as a function
        
        Or for custom functions as a decorator
        
            @infix
            def f(x,y):
                return x + 2 * y
        
            a = 1 |f| 2 # operator, can use any binary operator like / | * % << >> (beware of ** that is right to left)
            a = f(1, 2) # function
        
        ## dot and cross product
        
            a = (1,2,3) /dot/ (4,5,6) # use as an infix
            a = (1,2,3) |dot| (4,5,6) # can use any binary operator like / | * % << >> (beware of ** that is right to left)
            r = 2 + (1,2,3) /dot/ (4,5,6) # here "/" has priority over + like in normal python
            r = 2 + (1,2,3) *dot* (4,5,6) # for a dot PRODUCT, * seems logical
            r = 2 + dot((1,2,3), (4,5,6)) # still works as a function
        
        ## using '|' for low priority
        
            A + B |dot| C # is parsed as (A + B) |dot| C
        
        ## fractions
        
            from fractions import Fraction
            frac = infix(Fraction)
            a = 1 + 1 / 3      # floats are messy...
            a = 1 + 1 /frac/ 3 # just replace '/' by '/frac/' to use Fractions
            b = 2 * (a + 3) /frac/ (a + 1) # nicer complex expressions
        
        ## ranges, 2..5 in ruby ?
        
            @infix
            def inclusive(a,b):
                return range(a, b+1)
        
            for i in 2 /inclusive/ 5: # could also write |inclusive| or +inclusive+ or %inclusive% or 
                print(i) # 2 3 4 5
        
            for i in inclusive(2, 5): # can still be used as function
                print(i) # 2 3 4 5

            def plus_one(L):
                return [x+1 for x in L]
        
            Y = [1,2,7,0,2,0] |no_zero |plus_one # Y == [2,3,8,3]
            Y = plus_one(no_zero([1,2,7,0,2,0])) # Y == [2,3,8,3]

                return f
