This module adds an option "partner policy"
on account types.

You have the choice between 3 policies : optional (the default),
always (require a partner), and never (forbid a partner).

This module is useful to enforce a partner on account move lines on
customer and supplier accounts.

Module developed by St√©phane Bidoul <stephane.bidoul@acsone.eu>,
inspired by Alexis de Lattre <alexis.delattre@akretion.com>'s
account_analytic_required module.
