Description: brocket
        =======
        
        A command line tool for building `Amazon Associates`_ links with as few actions as possible.
        
        If you have a link in the clipboard, run this script, then the link on the clipboard becomes an `Amazon Associates`_ link.
        
        OS X Only
        ---------
        
        This is only for Mac OS X 10.8 or higher but it could easily be enhanced to support other operating systems.
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        After you ``pip install brocket`` just run ``brocket``. It will prompt you for your tracking-id. Enter it.
        
        Optional: Make sure it's correct by running ``brocket --show-tracking-id``.
        
        How to Make Links
        -----------------
        
        Once it's setup, the easiest thing to do is
        
         1. Browse to an Amazon URL you want an affiliate link for.
         2. Copy the URL
         3. Run the ``brocket`` command. This will tag the URL with your tracking-id and put the new URL on the clipboard.
         4. Paste the URL where ever you want it to go.
        
        Upping Your Game
        ----------------
        
        I know what you're thinking "4 steps?!? You mean I have to go to my browser and copy a URL, then run a terminal command, then go back...". Yeah yeah I hear you.
        
        There are probably lots of ways to skin this cat but here's what I did.
        
        Make an AppleScript called ``Brocket`` and save it in ``~/Library/Scripts``. It just needs to be 1 line::
        
           do shell script "/usr/local/bin/brocket"
        
        Then, if you haven't already install the wonderful `FastScripts`_. Your ``Brocket`` script should show up in the menu.
        
        Finally assign ``Brocket`` a keyboard shortcut and you can skip switching to the Terminal to run the Brocket command.
        
        Brocket Deer
        ------------
        
        This little utility is named for the `Brocket Deer`_ which lives around the Amazon river. It also sounds like Rocket, but with a 'B' and I was looking for something with a fast sounding name.
