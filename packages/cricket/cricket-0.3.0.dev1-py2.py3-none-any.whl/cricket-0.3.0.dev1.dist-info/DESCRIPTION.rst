Cricket is part of the `BeeWare suite`_. The project website is `http://pybee.org/cricket`_.

Cricket is a graphical tool that helps you run your test suites.

Normal test runners dump all output to the console, and provide very little
detail while the suite is running. As a result:

* You can't start looking at failures until the test suite has completed running,

* It isn't a very accessible format for identifying patterns in test failures,

* It can be hard (or cumbersome) to re-run any tests that have failed.

Why the name ``cricket``? `Test Cricket`_ is the most prestigious version of
the game of cricket. Games last for up to 5 days... just like running some
test suites. The usual approach for making cricket watchable is a generous
dose of beer; in programming, `Ballmer Peak`_ limits come into effect, so
something else is required...

Quickstart
----------

At present, Cricket has support for:

* unittest test suites; and
* `pytest <https://pytest.org>`__ test suites; and
* `Django <https://djangoproject.com>`__ 1.6+ project test suites

To use Cricket, install it with pip::

    $ pip install cricket

Then, to run your unittest suite::

    $ cricket-unittest

Or, in a pytest project::

    $ cricket-pytest

Or, in a Django project::

    $ cricket-django

``cricket-django`` will also work in Django's own tests directory -- i.e., you
can use ``cricket-django`` to run Django's own test suite (for Django 1.6 or
later).

Running cricket will display a GUI window. Hit "Run all", and watch your test
suite execute. A progress bar is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of
the window, along with an estimate of time remaining.

While the suite is running, you can click on test names to see the output of
that test. The icon in the tree, and the summary panel on the right, will
display the status of the test, as well as any output or error text.
