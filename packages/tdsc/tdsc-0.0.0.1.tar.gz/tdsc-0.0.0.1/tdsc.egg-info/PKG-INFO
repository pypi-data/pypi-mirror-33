Description: # Tiny Desired State Configuration
        
        A set of Python classes designed to facilitate repeatable machine provisioning,
        with flexibility to handle permutations based on tags. Designed for linux and
        unix machines, not tested for compatibility on Windows.
        
        ## Design Principles
        
        ### Python 2 and 3 compatible
        
        MacOS still ships with Python 2.7, Ubuntu 18.04 ships with ~3.6.
        
        ### No external dependencies
        
        Intended to just work when pulled down onto a fresh system. Optimally intended
        to be included as a submodule in a "dotfiles" type repository.
        
        ### Simple beats all
        
        Designed as the primary benefit over simply using shell scripts.
        
        ## Boundaries
        
        The following features are out of bounds, in order to fulfill the "tiny" aspect
        of the project's name:
        
        * Stateful operations, including:
          * Automatic reversion of states when a tag is no longer applied
          * Automatically skipping applied states unless changes were made to the state
        * Automatic dependency order resolution
        
        If you need any of the above features, consider using a more fully-featured
        orchestration management package, such as [SaltStack](https://saltstack.com/).
