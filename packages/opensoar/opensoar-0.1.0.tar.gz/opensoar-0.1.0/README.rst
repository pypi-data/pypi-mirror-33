The OpenSoar python library is meant to provide open source tooling for glider flight analysis. This may vary from 
thermal detection to competition scoring.

Reading in files with aerofiles
================================

OpenSoar only performs analyses after the files have been read in. The `aerofiles library <https://github.com/Turbo87/aerofiles>`_ provides the functionality
to read the files.

Example race task
==================
::

    from aerofiles.igc import Reader
    from opensoar.competition.soaringspot import get_info_from_comment_lines
    from opensoar.task.trip import Trip
    
    with open('example.igc', 'r') as f:
        parsed_igc_file = Reader().read(f)

    # example.igc comes from soaringspot and contains task inforamtion
    task, _, _ = get_info_from_comment_lines(parsed_igc_file)
    _, trace = parsed_igc_file['fix_records']
    
    trip = Trip(task, trace)
    task_distance_covered = sum(trip.distances)

Plan
====
A lot of functionality regarding analysis and competition scoring is currently present in the
`PySoar project <https://github.com/GliderGeek/PySoar>`_. It is the aim to take these functionalities, generalize them
and bundle them in this library.
