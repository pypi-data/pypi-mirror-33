Snippet container width type chooser
====================================

This module was written to extend the functionality of the website editor to
support choosing the width type between the available `Bootstrap container
types <http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container>`_:

* **Fixed**, which will have a fixed width that will depend on the user's
  screen width, and usually will have an empty margin at each side.

* **Fluid**, which will always fill 100% of the available width space.

Odoo's default value is usually **Fixed**, and remains the same.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Go to any website page.
* Press *Edit*.
* Press *Insert blocks*.
* Insert any block that uses a container, such as *Text block*.
* Click on an inner element and press *Select container block* (the button to
  select current element's parent) until you get to an HTML element with the
  class `container` or `container-fluid`.
* Select *Customize > Container width type* and choose one from there.
