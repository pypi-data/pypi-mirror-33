    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry object
        The Geometry object which this model is associated.  This is needed
        to access the other relevant geometrical properties for this
        calculation.

    throat_length and throat_diameter : strings
        The dictionary keys containing the arrays with the throat diameter and
        length values.

    Notes
    -----
    At present this models does NOT account for the volume reprsented by the
    intersection of the throat with a spherical pore body.
