    r"""
    Calculates internal surface area of pore bodies assuming they are spherical
    then subtracts the area of the neighboring throats in a crude way, by
    simply considering the throat cross-sectional area, thus not accounting
    for the actual curvature of the intersection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry : OpenPNM Geometry Object
        The Geometry object which this model is associated with. This controls
        the length of the calculated array, and also provides access to other
        necessary geometric properties.

    network : OpenPNM Network Object
        The Network object associated with the Geometry.  This is needed to
        provide some topological information such as throat connections, and
        neighboring pores.

    pore_diameter : string
        The dictionary key to the pore diameter array.

    throat_area : string
        The dictioanry key to the throat area array.  Throat areas are needed
        since their insection with the pore are removed from the computation.
