Description: ![mitoo: Machine learning in Python]
        
        # mitoo
        
        mitoo is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine build in
        Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on collections of
        known conversations. The language independent design of mitoo allows it
        to be trained to speak any language.
        
        An example of typical input would be something like this:
        
        > **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?  
        
        ## How it works
        
        An untrained instance of mitoo starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As mitoo receives more input the number of responses that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching response by searching for the closest matching known statement that matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people the bot communicates with.
